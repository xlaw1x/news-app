<p>Recognizing the evolving digital landscape shaped by technical advancements and socio-technical realities, professionals discussed the impact of digital advancements on Philippine democracy and rights in the Philippine Declaration of Internet Rights and Principles (PhilDec 2.0).</p>



<p>The plenary session of the Digital Rights Conference, held at Ateneo de Manila University last Thursday, March 21, also featured discussions on several key points, including artificial intelligence (AI), human rights, gender, environmental sustainability, and the post-pandemic digital ecosystems.</p>



<p>Alan Alegre, former executive director of the Foundation for Media Alternatives (FMA), along with other information and communications technology (ICT), media and human rights experts, stressed the need for an updated declaration. It addresses challenges made more difficult by the digital economy, such as the digital divide, hijacked democracies, disinformation, and the post-pandemic effects on digital rights and health.</p>



<p>“The digital economy as we were looking at it in 2015 has changed so much, both from what is developed technologically but also politically,” Alegre said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a 14-page draft, Alegre highlighted several newly added principles: addressing disinformation and harmful content to mitigate the harms to democracy and the digital public sphere; the sustainable use of the internet and ICTs amid the climate emergency; addressing power imbalances in digital societies through regulation, content moderation, and transparency; promoting more effective and equitable e-health systems; ICT systems and electoral integrity; and challenges posed by AI.</p>



<p>PhilDec 2.0 also included revisions from the <a href=""https://fma.ph/ph-declaration-internet-rights-principles/"">initial declaration</a> from 2015, emphasizing: open access to scientific, research, and academic content; addressing gender-based violence online through concrete programs and mechanisms to foster a transformative and safe internet space; and promoting human capital development through education, digital literacy, and e-learning including AI literacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alegre expressed hope that PhilDec 2.0 would become a “strategic reference” for various stakeholders, guiding its use in public education, policy development, social and political advocacy, and efforts related to gender and AI.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-potentials-and-perils-of-ai"">Potentials and perils of AI</h5>



<p>Discussing AI literacy, Alegre said the education system is “broken,” calling it a challenge that needs to be addressed. Online learning, he added, exacerbated the challenges, revealing disparities in internet access as people share gadgets in barangays and schools.</p>



<p>The Philippines scored among the lowest in the December 2023 <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/why-filipino-students-lagging-behind-global-assessments-tests/"">Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 rankings</a>, placing 77th out of 81 countries. Filipino students continued to struggle in reading, mathematics, and science, positioning the nation near the bottom in these key subjects.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a challenge, (but) we have to start somewhere, and the specific area of digital is important to build capacity strategically on all levels [such as] literacy, life-long learning, higher education, etc.,” Alegre said.</p>



<p>For Dominic Ligot, founder of CirroLytix and Data Ethics PH, AI needs to “become real and tangible to everyone” as it represents the next evolution of the internet, particularly generative AI.</p>



<p>Ligot advocated the use of AI “for good” by starting with risk management. This included recommendations for a discussion on the harms versus benefits of AI, its compliance with laws, and moral principles and guidelines governing the development and deployment of the use of AI technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>Ethics talaga ang bottomline. (Ethics really is the bottomline)</em>, Ligot said. &#8220;Is it fair, is it transparent, and who is accountable? If we can cover those three bases, maybe we can make a difference.&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Alegre addressed AI&#8217;s potential perils across economic, political, social, and environmental spheres, including job displacement, algorithmic bias, discrimination, privacy erosion, and the weaponization of AI, especially concerning elections, privacy, and gender issues. This underscores the necessity of a &#8220;human-centered approach&#8221; in AI development and deployment for its promised &#8220;innovation.&#8221;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-towards-a-human-centered-approach"">Towards a &#8216;human-centered&#8217; approach</h5>



<p>Despite concerns about AI, Alegre explained that there should be adoption of AI, but with &#8220;stricter development and deployment guidelines.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We cannot allow AI to steer itself and to steer us. There has to be a human-centered approach,” he stressed.</p>



<p>To achieve a human-centered approach, Alegre advocates for mitigating discrimination and bias, along with increased transparency, data protection, and a robust framework for certification, compliance audits, and accountability.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Emmanuel Lallana, chief executive of IdeaCorp Inc., warned of &#8220;anthropomorphism”, emphasizing that AI is “not about creating a human being,” but rather examining its models and algorithms.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you first understand the technology, then we&#8217;ll probably be in a better world,&#8221; Lallana said. <strong>– with reports from Angelica Paller/Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p class=""has-text-align-center""><strong>READ:</strong> <strong>Part 1 | <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/environment/critical-facilities-risk-flooding-sipalay-city-negros-occidental/"">Flood-prone lifelines: Critical facilities at risk of flooding in Negros Occidental town</a> &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class=""has-drop-cap"">NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – In Sipalay, critical facilities such as health facilities and schools were built in flood-prone areas. The local government is aware of this, yet these facilities have not been relocated even after being devastated during past disasters.</p>



<p>In the first part of this investigation, Rappler found that over half of Negros Occidental residents are at high risk of danger due to floods. Across the province, Sipalay ranked high among towns, with the most critical facilities constructed in flood-prone areas. At least three in 10 of these are located in vulnerable areas.</p>



<p>Negros Occidental also ranked 11th out of 84 provinces in terms of exposure to multiple hazard risks, the 2021 <a href=""https://www.pdc.org/wp-content/uploads/NDPBA-PHL-Province-Profile-New-Merged-compressed.pdf"">Philippine Province Risk Profiles</a> of Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) said.</p>



<p>During Typhoon Odette (Rai), Sipalaynons experienced firsthand how taking refuge in schools that double as evacuation centers can still expose them to flood risks. For them, it was a wake-up call. But for the local government, it didn&#8217;t appear to be enough.</p>



<p>Sipalay officials plan to construct two evacuation centers and relocate a few schools, but the relocation of all critical facilities away from flood-prone areas remains a challenge. Experts said that moving them out of flood zones is a complex process, and finding a solution that checks all the boxes takes time.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-officials-aware-of-flood-risks"">Officials aware of flood risks</h5>



<p>Months of analysis by the state hazard assessment portal HazardHunterPH data showed that Sipalay has the most number of schools among Negros Occidental towns with a very high risk of flooding. In the Philippines, schools serve as evacuation centers during disasters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sipalay City government said it is aware of the flood risks.</p>



<p>As part of pre-disaster meetings, the local government unit (LGU) uses government hazard maps from the environment department’s Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) and follows warnings from state weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Administration (PAGASA). They identify areas that might be affected and stock food and other necessities in those barangays.</p>



<p>Days before Odette hit, city officials said all the necessary preparations were made, save for mandatory evacuation. For them, it was the “lack” of information dissemination on the part of village officials and the reluctance of the residents to evacuate and listen to warnings that cost lives.</p>



<p>“The barangay was nowhere to be found, to be honest. They are part of the warning system but they are too lazy, probably,” Sipalay City Mayor Gina Lizares said.</p>



<p>Locals interviewed by Rappler confirmed that some of them knew about Odette’s strength due to the announcements made by the city government and the village officials, while others said they were not informed by the barangay beforehand.</p>

<p>At Sipalay City National High School (SCNHS), the designated evacuation center in Barangay V in the city proper, floodwaters reached the ground floor of the school, prompting evacuees to seek refuge on the second floor of the building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sipalay officials said that the Sipalay City gymnasium, a larger facility located in the center of the city proper, was also used as an evacuation center. Both the city gym and SCNHS are located in a very high-risk flood zone.</p>



<p>Towns with a high risk of floods may be submerged in one to two meters of water for over three days, according to the MGB. For most Filipinos, this is already waist- to chest-deep. Those with a very high susceptibility to floods may see more than two meters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As far as I know, flood-prone schools are not used as evacuation centers. They are usually brought to our covered courts and gymnasiums. Even if there’s flooding in that area, the gym is more protected,” Lizares said. Her staff confirmed the flood did not reach the city gym.</p>



<p>Since Odette, village officials have been advised to not use the evacuation centers located within their barangays, especially for expected major disasters. Instead, they were told to evacuate to the facility in Gil Montilla in central Sipalay which would be safer, according to disaster officials. Gil Montilla is where the city’s new government center was built.</p>



<p>“What we wanted to instill in the barangays is no matter what the weather condition might look, if PAGASA says the typhoon will be disastrous, they shouldn’t be complacent. They must do what they need to do,” the city’s Public Safety Officer Dionilo Bogtae said.</p>



<p>The city government also moved to strengthen the village disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) offices by conducting more training so that they would be able to fend for themselves if the unimaginable happens.</p>



<p>“We know that the [city] DRRMO can only handle a few [areas] when it comes to disaster. Remote areas should know how to handle themselves,” Sipalay City Information Officer James Lim said. “During Odette, the rescuers were here and they could not access the barangays. They could not access the roads going to remote areas because of the debris in the flood.”</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Moving schools out of harm’s way</h5>



<p>Odette hit at a time when the Philippines was still reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>By the end of 2022, Sipalay had already used up around three-fourths of its disaster funds. The mayor said the main expenditure that year was the response to the aftermath of Odette, on top of expenses related to the pandemic. Then, Severe Tropical Storm Paeng (Nalgae) hit the city in late 2022.</p>



<p>Data from the Commission on Audit showed that Sipalay spent P56.6 million out of its P72.3 million ($1.3 million)* worth of disaster funds in 2022. Of the budget, the city spent around P800 ($14) per resident. Sipalay had the highest disaster spending per resident among LGUs in Negros Occidental – almost thrice the provincial average of about P260 ($5) in 2022.</p>



<iframe title=""How much does Negros Occidental spend per person on DRRM?"" aria-label=""Column Chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-8lTJc"" src=""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8lTJc/15/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""926"" data-external=""1""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>



<p>While this is considered a relatively high utilization rate, Lizares said their aim is to spend even more of their disaster funds in the coming years – at least 80% compared to the current 78% utilization rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“During [the COVID-19 pandemic], we were very focused. We wanted to see to it that we are proactive, not reactive. So we used the funds for the things we foresaw that we’d need in the future during that time,” Lizares said.</p>



<p>Sipalay officials told Rappler the city aims to relocate a few of the schools being used as evacuation centers because of the risks. But Lim said that the city is facing land ownership issues in the process.</p>



<p>Cabadiangan National High School is among the schools eyed for relocation to a “higher elevation.” The high school, despite being in a “safe” location, according to state hazard maps, is close to flood zones that may block residents' access to roads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high school is located in the barangay that saw the most deaths during Odette.</p>

Learning from Odette, Sipalay City Information Officer James Lim says that city officials are in the process of improving disaster mitigation of the city, including plans to relocate several flood-prone schools. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler</figcaption></figure>



<p>The plan to relocate the Cabadiangan public school has been ongoing, and the city has already discussed its plan with the Department of Education (DepEd).</p>



<p>Lim said the city has been looking for landowners who may want to sell land. Officials also explored another site, but they need approval from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources since part of the area falls within forest land.</p>



<p>For other flood-prone schools, the information officer said the city is still looking for new sites for their relocation.</p>



<p>As for SCNHS, Lizares said it would be moved to a different location not because of flood risk but because the lot it occupies belongs to Barangay V Elementary School.</p>



<p>“The only reason we are planning to move [SCNHS] out of there is because two schools in one area are too crowded. When it (elementary school) expands, we need the bigger area that is already occupied by the high school,” the Sipalay mayor said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Relocation: A complex process</h5>



<p>In the Philippines, evacuation centers, health facilities, and schools built in flood zones are more common than you think.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335445955_EVALUATION_OF_THE_SPATIAL_DISTRIBUTION_OF_EVACUATION_CENTERS_IN_METRO_MANILA_PHILIPPINES"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">2019 peer-reviewed study</a> found that almost half of all evacuation centers in Metro Manila are also at risk of floods. The researchers of the study recommended “reevaluating” the locations of evacuation centers to facilitate prompt disaster response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do exactly that, disaster risk management experts told Rappler that the government needs to face several hurdles to move critical facilities to safety.</p>



<p>The operations center director of the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF), an organization that serves as coordinator for DRRM activities for the private sector, said there are many considerations in relocating evacuation centers – relocation costs are one thing, finding new locations is another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For a country that is at the top for natural hazard exposure, it may be challenging to identify a suitable location for these facilities that also meet necessary criteria such as proximity to the community, public transport accessibility, connection to basic amenities, among others,” PDRF’s Arnel Capili told Rappler.</p>



<p>Capili has decades of experience in disaster risk management. He used to be the regional director of the Department of National Defense’s Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Bicol from 1997 to 2007.</p>



<p>According to him, relocation involves logistical challenges that, if not addressed properly, can lead to delays. And a country that is exposed to multiple hazards, including an average of 20 typhoons a year, cannot afford delays.</p>



<p>“Relocation is indeed a complex process, hence, moving forward, it is important for the government to get things right from the start by conducting a thorough risk assessment in selecting sites for new facilities, including working with experts to incorporate resilient design features,” Capili said.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ricardo Jalad, ex-OCD administrator and former executive director of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, pointed out that relocation “depends on the resources available and the priorities of the office concerned.”</p>



<p>Under the <a href=""https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2010/05/27/republic-act-no-10121/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">law</a>, LGUs must allocate at least 5% of their revenues to the local disaster fund. Ideally, the wealthier a city is, the higher its disaster funds. Jalad suggested that the national government come in because all critical facilities that it constructs are put under strict evaluation by the RDRRMC.</p>



<p>“Maybe [the Department of Public Works and Highways] should include in their annual budget the relocation of critical facilities like schools, evacuation centers, and health facilities from no-build areas to safe areas,” Jalad said.</p>



<p>The former NDRRMC chief pointed out that, ultimately, it comes down to whether local governments will take decisive action.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a matter of political will on the part of the LGUs on the enforcement of their comprehensive land use plans (CLUP) and related powers like issuance of building permits [when building new schools],” said Jalad.</p>



<p>Under Republic Act No. 7976 or the Local Government Code, LGUs are mandated to have CLUPs and keep them updated. In a <a href=""https://dhsud.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/Publication/Guidebooks/HLURB_CLUP_Vol_1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">guide</a> created by the former Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, the precursor to the housing department, LGUs are encouraged to analyze risks for areas that may be affected by hazards. Land zoning recommendations could range from implementing a no-build zone for a specific area to managing risks instead.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Building evacuation centers can be costly</h5>



<p>If the relocation of critical facilities is too complex a problem, why not build new ones then?</p>



<p>According to Capili, the national government should set “broad” policies and regulations related to the identification of the sites for construction, and safety standards, among others. Local governments should localize such policies to their needs, ensure that these are followed, and make specific decisions regarding site selection, design, and construction.</p>



<p>In the case of Sipalay, the mayor also does not think relocating schools in the city proper would be wise. “The whole poblacion (city proper) is at high risk, so why just move the schools?”</p>



<p>The mayor said that the city is building two evacuation centers for Sipalaynons –&nbsp;one at Gil Montilla and one in the city proper. Construction of the P16.9-million ($305,000) evacuation center in Gil Montilla <a href=""https://digicastnegros.com/p16-9-m-evac-center-to-rise-in-sipalay-city/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">started</a> in December 2020. It is still ongoing.</p>



<p>Capili agrees that building new evacuation centers may be better than relocation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is probably more practical to construct new evacuation centers that satisfy current building codes, aligned with standards [such as] PWD (persons-with-disability) access, lactation rooms, et cetera, and more importantly, away from hazards that may potentially impact its safety.”</p>



<p>In March 2023, the House of Representatives approved on third and final reading <a href=""https://hrep-website.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/legisdocs/first_19/CR00351.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">House Bill No. 7354</a>, which seeks to mandate every city and municipality to have at least one permanent evacuation center that is up to par with national government and international standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://legacy.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=19&amp;q=HBN-7354"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">counterpart measure</a> at the Senate has passed the committee level but has yet to be taken up at the plenary.</p>



<p>According to the House bill, permanent evacuation centers must be designed to withstand wind speeds of at least 300 kilometers per hour (km/h) and earthquakes of at least magnitude 8. To put this requirement in context, Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) had maximum sustained winds of 315 km/h, while the strongest earthquake that hit the Philippines was the magnitude-8 Moro Gulf quake in 1976.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from structural requirements, the bill also proposes that the new facilities be well-ventilated, have a large capacity, and have amenities such as sleeping quarters, one shower and one toilet per 20 persons, and food preparation areas, among others.</p>



<p>It comes with a hefty price tag for the national government, eyed by Congress to be the sole financier for this ambitious undertaking.</p>



<p>In a <a href=""https://cpbrd.congress.gov.ph/images/PDF%20Attachments/Discussion%20Paper/DP2023-04_Estimating_the_Cost_of_Establishing_an_Evacuation_Center_in_Every_City_and_Municipality_final.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">discussion paper</a>, the Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department (CPBRD) in the lower chamber estimated that building a two-story evacuation center for each of the over 500 cities and municipalities in the country would require P33.4 billion ($602 million), or an average of P64.8 million ($1.17 million) per building, aside from the price of land where it would be built. </p>



<p>The policy research office used Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) costing for a 2019 evacuation center project and computed for 2022 prices.</p>



<p>The CPBRD noted that the total amount needed to finance the program would be a huge expenditure for the national government – plus, the DPWH has a track record of having a weak absorptive capacity, or its inability to efficiently spend money to complete projects without delay.</p>



<p>In CPBRD’s estimates, a new evacuation center in Western Visayas, the region where Negros Occidental is located, would cost around P62.6 million ($1.13 million), which is easily about 90% of Sipalay’s total disaster funds in 2022.</p>



<p>In contrast, the evacuation center at Gil Montilla being built by the Sipalay City government is around two-thirds less expensive. PDRF also told Rappler that it built multipurpose facilities that serve as evacuation centers during disasters at P25 million ($451,000) each, which is half the price of the CPBRD’s estimate.</p>



<p>If the bill is passed, the policy research office recommends that the government explore other financing options for this program, including climate financing or partnerships with the private sector. It also said it would slash costs if the LGU donated land for the evacuation center.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">‘Demand investments in preparedness’</h5>



<p>Experts agree that investing in preparedness goes a long way than focusing resources on response. Capili noted, however, that investments in preparedness or DRR are “not that visible” to the public.</p>



<p>The disaster risk expert noted that investment in preparedness comes with a good early warning system, robust emergency communication system, and evacuation centers built according to standards.</p>



<p>“To make matters worse, they (long-term investments) can be more costly and more time-consuming –&nbsp;beyond the 3-year term of locally-elected officials,” Capili said.</p>



<p>Take Sipalay’s evacuation center as an example. Construction in Gil Montilla started in late 2020 and has been ongoing for over three years now, outliving the pandemic and the last local election in 2022.</p>



<p>Capili said that residents should start demanding higher investments in disaster preparedness from their local governments.</p>



<p>“What is more important is to highlight the long-term benefits from investments in preparedness and DRR rather than a short-term dole-out mentality.… By doing so, governments can minimize the costs associated with recovery and rehabilitation, and more importantly, families can now shelter in place,” he said.</p>



<p>More than two years after Odette, Sipalaynons still have vivid memories of their harrowing experience during the typhoon.</p>



<p>Looking back, Felizardo dela Cruz, a Cabadiangan resident whose house was swept away by floods with him in it, said that he would have evacuated to a safer place if the Sipalay government had asked him to.</p>



<p>Narcisso Biasong, whose wife and grandchild died after trying to seek shelter from the raging typhoon, resented the city government. “I was sleepless after Odette.… When someone asks her (mayor) how is Sipalay, she just answers, ‘We’re okay.’ Is it really ‘okay’ if many people died?”</p>



<p>While the issues with evacuation centers are being discussed by the government, many Filipinos – not just in Sipalay – will have no choice but to continue putting their lives at stake by depending on these high-risk critical facilities every time a disaster hits the country. –&nbsp;<strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

The local government is aware of this, yet these facilities have not been relocated even after being devastated during past disasters.      In the first part of this investigation, Rappler found that over half of Negros Occidental residents are at high risk of danger due to floods. Across the province, Sipalay ranked high among towns, with the most critical facilities constructed in flood-prone areas. At least three in 10 of these are located in vulnerable areas.      Negros Occidental also ranked 11th out of 84 provinces in terms of exposure to multiple hazard risks, the 2021  Philippine Province Risk Profiles  of Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) said.      During Typhoon Odette (Rai), Sipalaynons experienced firsthand how taking refuge in schools that double as evacuation centers can still expose them to flood risks. For them, it was a wake-up call. But for the local government, it didn't appear to be enough.      Sipalay officials plan to construct two evacuation centers and relocate a few schools, but the relocation of all critical facilities away from flood-prone areas remains a challenge. Experts said that moving them out of flood zones is a complex process, and finding a solution that checks all the boxes takes time.      Officials aware of flood risks      Months of analysis by the state hazard assessment portal HazardHunterPH data showed that Sipalay has the most number of schools among Negros Occidental towns with a very high risk of flooding. In the Philippines, schools serve as evacuation centers during disasters.       The Sipalay City government said it is aware of the flood risks.      As part of pre-disaster meetings, the local government unit (LGU) uses government hazard maps from the environment department's Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) and follows warnings from state weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Administration (PAGASA). They identify areas that might be affected and stock food and other necessities in those barangays.      Days before Odette hit, city officials said all the necessary preparations were made, save for mandatory evacuation. For them, it was the ""lack"" of information dissemination on the part of village officials and the reluctance of the residents to evacuate and listen to warnings that cost lives.      ""The barangay was nowhere to be found, to be honest. They are part of the warning system but they are too lazy, probably,"" Sipalay City Mayor Gina Lizares said.      Locals interviewed by Rappler confirmed that some of them knew about Odette's strength due to the announcements made by the city government and the village officials, while others said they were not informed by the barangay beforehand.        LAZY. Sipalay City Mayor Gina Lizares claims that city officials did their part to prepare Sipalaynons for Odette, calling village officials ‘lazy' for allegedly not doing enough to warn residents. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler.com       At Sipalay City National High School (SCNHS), the designated evacuation center in Barangay V in the city proper, floodwaters reached the ground floor of the school, prompting evacuees to seek refuge on the second floor of the building.       Sipalay officials said that the Sipalay City gymnasium, a larger facility located in the center of the city proper, was also used as an evacuation center. Both the city gym and SCNHS are located in a very high-risk flood zone.      Towns with a high risk of floods may be submerged in one to two meters of water for over three days, according to the MGB. For most Filipinos, this is already waist- to chest-deep. Those with a very high susceptibility to floods may see more than two meters.       ""As far as I know, flood-prone schools are not used as evacuation centers. They are usually brought to our covered courts and gymnasiums. Even if there's flooding in that area, the gym is more protected,"" Lizares said. Her staff confirmed the flood did not reach the city gym.      Since Odette, village officials have been advised to not use the evacuation centers located within their barangays, especially for expected major disasters. Instead, they were told to evacuate to the facility in Gil Montilla in central Sipalay which would be safer, according to disaster officials. Gil Montilla is where the city's new government center was built.      ""What we wanted to instill in the barangays is no matter what the weather condition might look, if PAGASA says the typhoon will be disastrous, they shouldn't be complacent. They must do what they need to do,"" the city's Public Safety Officer Dionilo Bogtae said.      The city government also moved to strengthen the village disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) offices by conducting more training so that they would be able to fend for themselves if the unimaginable happens.      ""We know that the [city] DRRMO can only handle a few [areas] when it comes to disaster. Remote areas should know how to handle themselves,"" Sipalay City Information Officer James Lim said. ""During Odette, the rescuers were here and they could not access the barangays. They could not access the roads going to remote areas because of the debris in the flood.""      Moving schools out of harm's way      Odette hit at a time when the Philippines was still reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.      By the end of 2022, Sipalay had already used up around three-fourths of its disaster funds. The mayor said the main expenditure that year was the response to the aftermath of Odette, on top of expenses related to the pandemic. Then, Severe Tropical Storm Paeng (Nalgae) hit the city in late 2022.      Data from the Commission on Audit showed that Sipalay spent P56.6 million out of its P72.3 million ($1.3 million)* worth of disaster funds in 2022. Of the budget, the city spent around P800 ($14) per resident. Sipalay had the highest disaster spending per resident among LGUs in Negros Occidental - almost thrice the provincial average of about P260 ($5) in 2022.                While this is considered a relatively high utilization rate, Lizares said their aim is to spend even more of their disaster funds in the coming years - at least 80% compared to the current 78% utilization rate.       ""During [the COVID-19 pandemic], we were very focused. We wanted to see to it that we are proactive, not reactive. So we used the funds for the things we foresaw that we'd need in the future during that time,"" Lizares said.      Sipalay officials told Rappler the city aims to relocate a few of the schools being used as evacuation centers because of the risks. But Lim said that the city is facing land ownership issues in the process.      Cabadiangan National High School is among the schools eyed for relocation to a ""higher elevation."" The high school, despite being in a ""safe"" location, according to state hazard maps, is close to flood zones that may block residents' access to roads.       The high school is located in the barangay that saw the most deaths during Odette.        POST-ODETTE. Learning from Odette, Sipalay City Information Officer James Lim says that city officials are in the process of improving disaster mitigation of the city, including plans to relocate several flood-prone schools. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler       The plan to relocate the Cabadiangan public school has been ongoing, and the city has already discussed its plan with the Department of Education (DepEd).      Lim said the city has been looking for landowners who may want to sell land. Officials also explored another site, but they need approval from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources since part of the area falls within forest land.      For other flood-prone schools, the information officer said the city is still looking for new sites for their relocation.      As for SCNHS, Lizares said it would be moved to a different location not because of flood risk but because the lot it occupies belongs to Barangay V Elementary School.      ""The only reason we are planning to move [SCNHS] out of there is because two schools in one area are too crowded. When it (elementary school) expands, we need the bigger area that is already occupied by the high school,"" the Sipalay mayor said.      Relocation: A complex process      In the Philippines, evacuation centers, health facilities, and schools built in flood zones are more common than you think.       A  2019 peer-reviewed study  found that almost half of all evacuation centers in Metro Manila are also at risk of floods. The researchers of the study recommended ""reevaluating"" the locations of evacuation centers to facilitate prompt disaster response.       To do exactly that, disaster risk management experts told Rappler that the government needs to face several hurdles to move critical facilities to safety.      The operations center director of the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF), an organization that serves as coordinator for DRRM activities for the private sector, said there are many considerations in relocating evacuation centers - relocation costs are one thing, finding new locations is another.       ""For a country that is at the top for natural hazard exposure, it may be challenging to identify a suitable location for these facilities that also meet necessary criteria such as proximity to the community, public transport accessibility, connection to basic amenities, among others,"" PDRF's Arnel Capili told Rappler.      Capili has decades of experience in disaster risk management. He used to be the regional director of the Department of National Defense's Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Bicol from 1997 to 2007.      According to him, relocation involves logistical challenges that, if not addressed properly, can lead to delays. And a country that is exposed to multiple hazards, including an average of 20 typhoons a year, cannot afford delays.      ""Relocation is indeed a complex process, hence, moving forward, it is important for the government to get things right from the start by conducting a thorough risk assessment in selecting sites for new facilities, including working with experts to incorporate resilient design features,"" Capili said.      Meanwhile, Ricardo Jalad, ex-OCD administrator and former executive director of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, pointed out that relocation ""depends on the resources available and the priorities of the office concerned.""      Under the  law , LGUs must allocate at least 5% of their revenues to the local disaster fund. Ideally, the wealthier a city is, the higher its disaster funds. Jalad suggested that the national government come in because all critical facilities that it constructs are put under strict evaluation by the RDRRMC.      ""Maybe [the Department of Public Works and Highways] should include in their annual budget the relocation of critical facilities like schools, evacuation centers, and health facilities from no-build areas to safe areas,"" Jalad said.      The former NDRRMC chief pointed out that, ultimately, it comes down to whether local governments will take decisive action.      ""I think it's a matter of political will on the part of the LGUs on the enforcement of their comprehensive land use plans (CLUP) and related powers like issuance of building permits [when building new schools],"" said Jalad.      Under Republic Act No. 7976 or the Local Government Code, LGUs are mandated to have CLUPs and keep them updated. In a  guide  created by the former Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, the precursor to the housing department, LGUs are encouraged to analyze risks for areas that may be affected by hazards. Land zoning recommendations could range from implementing a no-build zone for a specific area to managing risks instead.      Building evacuation centers can be costly      If the relocation of critical facilities is too complex a problem, why not build new ones then?      According to Capili, the national government should set ""broad"" policies and regulations related to the identification of the sites for construction, and safety standards, among others. Local governments should localize such policies to their needs, ensure that these are followed, and make specific decisions regarding site selection, design, and construction.      In the case of Sipalay, the mayor also does not think relocating schools in the city proper would be wise. ""The whole poblacion (city proper) is at high risk, so why just move the schools?""      The mayor said that the city is building two evacuation centers for Sipalaynons - one at Gil Montilla and one in the city proper. Construction of the P16.9-million ($305,000) evacuation center in Gil Montilla  started  in December 2020. It is still ongoing.      Capili agrees that building new evacuation centers may be better than relocation.       ""It is probably more practical to construct new evacuation centers that satisfy current building codes, aligned with standards [such as] PWD (persons-with-disability) access, lactation rooms, et cetera, and more importantly, away from hazards that may potentially impact its safety.""      In March 2023, the House of Representatives approved on third and final reading  House Bill No. 7354 , which seeks to mandate every city and municipality to have at least one permanent evacuation center that is up to par with national government and international standards.       The  counterpart measure  at the Senate has passed the committee level but has yet to be taken up at the plenary.      According to the House bill, permanent evacuation centers must be designed to withstand wind speeds of at least 300 kilometers per hour (km/h) and earthquakes of at least magnitude 8. To put this requirement in context, Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) had maximum sustained winds of 315 km/h, while the strongest earthquake that hit the Philippines was the magnitude-8 Moro Gulf quake in 1976.       Aside from structural requirements, the bill also proposes that the new facilities be well-ventilated, have a large capacity, and have amenities such as sleeping quarters, one shower and one toilet per 20 persons, and food preparation areas, among others.      It comes with a hefty price tag for the national government, eyed by Congress to be the sole financier for this ambitious undertaking.      In a  discussion paper , the Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department (CPBRD) in the lower chamber estimated that building a two-story evacuation center for each of the over 500 cities and municipalities in the country would require P33.4 billion ($602 million), or an average of P64.8 million ($1.17 million) per building, aside from the price of land where it would be built.       The policy research office used Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) costing for a 2019 evacuation center project and computed for 2022 prices.      The CPBRD noted that the total amount needed to finance the program would be a huge expenditure for the national government - plus, the DPWH has a track record of having a weak absorptive capacity, or its inability to efficiently spend money to complete projects without delay.      In CPBRD's estimates, a new evacuation center in Western Visayas, the region where Negros Occidental is located, would cost around P62.6 million ($1.13 million), which is easily about 90% of Sipalay's total disaster funds in 2022.      In contrast, the evacuation center at Gil Montilla being built by the Sipalay City government is around two-thirds less expensive. PDRF also told Rappler that it built multipurpose facilities that serve as evacuation centers during disasters at P25 million ($451,000) each, which is half the price of the CPBRD's estimate.      If the bill is passed, the policy research office recommends that the government explore other financing options for this program, including climate financing or partnerships with the private sector. It also said it would slash costs if the LGU donated land for the evacuation center.       'Demand investments in preparedness'      Experts agree that investing in preparedness goes a long way than focusing resources on response. Capili noted, however, that investments in preparedness or DRR are ""not that visible"" to the public.      The disaster risk expert noted that investment in preparedness comes with a good early warning system, robust emergency communication system, and evacuation centers built according to standards.      ""To make matters worse, they (long-term investments) can be more costly and more time-consuming - beyond the 3-year term of locally-elected officials,"" Capili said.

<p class=""has-drop-cap"">NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – It was pitch-black outside Felizardo dela Cruz&#8217;s nipa hut, making it impossible to see what was happening as the wind howled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already 69 at the time, Dela Cruz could not see anything beyond the faint silhouette of the bamboo walls of his hut that kept him safe from the vicious storm.</p>



<p>The howling wind and the raging currents of the river a stone&#8217;s throw from his home were deafening. Typhoon Odette (Rai) was unleashing all its fury.</p>



<p>Dela Cruz was about to leave his hut to seek shelter at the nearest evacuation center – a two-hour walk from where he was – when he saw floodwaters rising. He thought his home would soon be swallowed by the water.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that moment, Dela Cruz faced the same tough questions that hundreds of thousands of Filipino families have had to ask themselves when a disaster is imminent: Will we survive at home? Will we survive the journey to the shelter? If we make it to the shelter, will it offer us more protection than staying at home?</p>



<p>Accepting his fate, Dela Cruz decided to stay put.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, he began to feel dizzy as he felt the bamboo floor rocking back and forth. His furniture started moving, some of them getting knocked over. Already half-submerged in water, his home was getting washed away by a flash flood – with him inside.</p>



<p>Shivering in the cold, Dela Cruz mustered all his strength to cry for help but immediately realized he was all alone with no one to rescue him. He kept still and just tried to survive the night.</p>



<p>Then he noticed that his hut stopped moving. He stepped out, only to discover that the raging waters had washed his home all the way to Tauangan, a sitio about nine kilometers away.</p>



<p>When the adrenaline rush subsided, Dela Cruz felt pain in his right foot and saw a four- to five-inch nail piercing his shin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was lucky because I survived. A lot of people died because of Odette. If I had left my house, I’d probably have died back then,&#8221; Dela Cruz said in Hiligaynon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dela Cruz lives in Kalatong, a low-lying area where the tributary rivers of Cabadiangan and Kalatong merge with the Sipalay River, about 900 kilometers south of Manila. Kalatong is located in Cabadiangan, the village with the highest death toll in Sipalay City, Negros Occidental, during Odette.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Months of analysis by Rappler unpacked who the most exposed to natural hazards in Negros Occidental are. This is among the provinces in the Philippines with the highest exposure to multiple hazards and risks. </p>



<p>The investigation also looked at whose houses are most at risk of being washed away, which evacuation centers across the province are most likely to keep people safe, and which ones might put people in greater danger. In the second part of this investigation, Rappler explored what the local government is doing about these.</p>

<p>Odette made landfall <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/philippines-super-typhoon-rai-odette-humanitarian-needs-and-priorities-revision"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">nine times</a> from December 16 to 17, 2021, as it made its way through southern and central Philippines. It left massive destruction in different parts of all island groups in the Philippines, destroying homes, damaging roads and bridges, and toppling communication and power lines.</p>



<p>According to then-United Nations representative to the Philippines Gustavo Gonzalez, Odette was the <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/statement-mr-gustavo-gonzalez-un-resident-coordinator-and-humanitarian-0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">second deadliest disaster</a> to hit the globe in 2021, next to the magnitude 7.2 <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/technical-report-haiti-earthquake-interconnected-disaster-risks-20212022"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">earthquake</a> in Haiti. </p>



<p>Gonzalez said the damage caused by the typhoon was &#8220;comparable&#8221; to that caused by <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/ten-years-super-typhoon-yolanda-survivors-grapple-memory-delayed-recovery/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Super Typhoon Yolanda</a> (Haiyan), one of the most powerful typhoons in history. Though the magnitudes of the storms were impossible to measure and compare exactly, the number of people who were vulnerable to such disasters was not.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-people-in-peril"">People in peril&nbsp;</h5>



<p>Dela Cruz&#8217;s almost biblical story of survival was just one among the hundreds of thousands of stories of Negrosanons who were affected by flooding caused by Odette. According to <a href=""https://www.foi.gov.ph/requests/aglzfmVmb2ktcGhyHQsSB0NvbnRlbnQiEE9DRC02NTA5MjcyMjMwMjMM"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">data</a> from the Office of Civil Defense, a total of 1.5 million Negrosanons were affected by the typhoon, and government maps show that many of them were at risk.</p>



<p>Analysis of the data from state hazard assessment portal HazardHunterPH showed that more than 380,000 people in Negros Occidental are at high risk of flooding. Overall, more than half of all residents in the province live in areas that have varying degrees of flood risk.</p>



<p>According to the environment department’s Mines and Geosciences Bureau, one of the government offices involved in the creation of the hazard assessment portal, towns with a high risk of floods may be submerged in one to two meters of water for over three days. For most Filipinos, the depth is already waist to chest-deep. Those with a very high susceptibility to floods may experience more than two meters of flooding.</p>

<p>According to our analysis, one out of every seven people in Sipalay City, where Dela Cruz lives, resides in areas at high risk of flooding. A quarter of them are children younger than 10 years old.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Houses at risk</h5>



<p>Despite the availability of official data identifying risks of flooding, this has not translated to the construction of flood-resistant houses. More than half of the province’s cities and municipalities are also vulnerable to destruction by typhoons, according to a <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590061721000715"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">2021 study</a> done by researchers at The University of Sydney School of Civil Engineering.</p>



<p>The Housing Vulnerability Index (HVI), as the researchers called it, was calculated by measuring and aggregating several components at the municipal level – including how crowded a house was, the quality of materials used, structural integrity, and the availability of water sources, among others – to determine how vulnerable homes are to disasters brought by typhoons.</p>



<p>Negros Occidental also ranked 11th out of 84 provinces in terms of exposure to multiple hazard risks, according to the 2021 <a href=""https://www.pdc.org/wp-content/uploads/NDPBA-PHL-Province-Profile-New-Merged-compressed.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Philippine Province Risk Profiles</a> of Pacific Disaster Center (PDC).</p>



<p>On top of these, if the towns<strong> </strong>in Negros Occidental are ranked according to poverty incidence and the number of health facilities and schools in high-risk flood zones, Sipalay City emerges as having the most vulnerable houses, the highest poverty rate, and the most facilities at risk of flooding. Based on the latest municipal-level estimates, almost one in four Sipalay residents earned below P20,464 ($388) a month in 2018, which is insufficient to meet basic food requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unaware of just how vulnerable they are, many Sipalay City residents ignored voluntary evacuation orders ahead of Odette. Local officials said that Odette was the most powerful typhoon they experienced in recent memory.</p>



<p>Narcisso Biasong, a charcoal maker from Barangay Mambaroto, said he had heard the local government’s warning about Odette through the <em>korida</em>, a public announcement system that makes the rounds in the city in times of disasters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He told his family about the warning but admitted that he and his family dismissed it. “We were complacent because many storms have passed but we were spared from them and nothing happened,” he told Rappler.</p>

Biasong told Rappler that he regrets deciding too late to go to the evacuation center, which cost the lives of his wife and grandchild. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instead of going to an evacuation center, Biasong’s family stayed home that day. Only when the flood was already hip-high did his family decide to take refuge in their neighbor’s house located on higher ground; it was too late to go to the evacuation center, which was a 30-minute walk across farm fields.</p>



<p>By the time they decided to flee, floodwaters were already raging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My wife and grandchild were those washed away by the flood. I can still hear my wife shouting for help when she was carried away by the flood. I was the only one who remained in my house, while the rest made it to our neighbor on higher ground,” Biasong told Rappler. His wife and grandchild died.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Critical facilities in danger&nbsp;</h5>



<p>In the Philippines, it&#8217;s rare to find evacuation centers used exclusively for disasters. Data from the Office of Civil Defense in 2019 showed that only about 3 in 100 of the total evacuation centers in the Philippines are primarily used as refuge during disasters.</p>



<p>In the whole of Negros Occidental, there are only five evacuation centers,&nbsp;three of which are located in high-risk areas. In Sipalay, there are none; instead, the city’s health centers, government buildings, and schools double as evacuation centers during these perilous times.</p>



<p>Data analysis suggests that in the case of Biasong, he had no good evacuation options because both his house and nearby facilities were extremely vulnerable. Schools in Sipalay City, supposed to be safe havens in the city during disasters, were not spared by the floods brought by Odette.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Analysis of HazardHunterPH data shows that Sipalay has the most number of schools with a very high risk of flooding in Negros Occidental. About one in four schools is in high-risk and very high-risk flood zones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>May Intac Matia-ong, a health unit staff in Barangay 5, told Rappler that during Odette, there were areas in her barangay “with neck-deep floods,” which she attributed to heavy rains and proximity to the shore. She said two families who evacuated with them had to stay on the second floor as the ground floor “was already flooded.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The health unit staff told Rappler that most people in their barangay evacuated to Sipalay City National High School and Barangay V (Sipalay) Elementary School.<strong> </strong>The two schools were in the same compound.</p>



<p>The schools Matia-ong mentioned were not the only ones at risk of flooding. Several other schools, health facilities, and evacuation centers across the province were built in flood zones.</p>

<p>Almost half of all health facilities in Sipalay City are at very high risk of flooding. Of the 19 facilities, eight are Barangay Health Units (BHU), while one is a Rural Health Unit (RHU). BHUs and RHUs are part of the primary level of the Philippines’ healthcare system.</p>



<p>Sipalay is followed by Cadiz, a city in northern Negros Occidental. A quarter of its schools and half of its evacuation centers are in high-risk flood zones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another city worth taking note of is Himamaylan City in central Negros Occidental. It has only two facilities used exclusively as evacuation centers, with one facility located in a high-risk flood zone.</p>



<p>Recounting her experience during Odette, Matia-ong told Rappler: “Despite Sipalay City National High School being on higher ground, the flood still reached the rooms where we stayed during Typhoon Odette. We know that the flood will reach the area where we are evacuated because our place is really prone to flooding. Barangay V is located in a low-lying area.”</p>



<p>“Typhoons hit us only a few times, but when it happens, there&#8217;s a high chance that we will get flooded,” she added.</p>



<p>After Odette, Sipalay officials have asked residents living near Kalatong River like Dela Cruz to move to higher ground.</p>



<p>The city government also said it plans to relocate some of the schools out of flood zones. Experts warn that it would not be an easy task.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for Sipalay City National High School, officials said it would also be moved to a different location due to land ownership issues – and not because of the flood risk.</p>

The howling wind and the raging currents of the river a stone's throw from his home were deafening. Typhoon Odette (Rai) was unleashing all its fury.      Dela Cruz was about to leave his hut to seek shelter at the nearest evacuation center - a two-hour walk from where he was - when he saw floodwaters rising. He thought his home would soon be swallowed by the water.       At that moment, Dela Cruz faced the same tough questions that hundreds of thousands of Filipino families have had to ask themselves when a disaster is imminent: Will we survive at home? Will we survive the journey to the shelter? If we make it to the shelter, will it offer us more protection than staying at home?      Accepting his fate, Dela Cruz decided to stay put.        BAMBOO HUT. Felizardo dela Cruz survived Odette's raging floods by staying in his bamboo hut, a structure almost identical to his current home where he sits as he tells his almost biblical story. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler       A few minutes later, he began to feel dizzy as he felt the bamboo floor rocking back and forth. His furniture started moving, some of them getting knocked over. Already half-submerged in water, his home was getting washed away by a flash flood - with him inside.      Shivering in the cold, Dela Cruz mustered all his strength to cry for help but immediately realized he was all alone with no one to rescue him. He kept still and just tried to survive the night.      Then he noticed that his hut stopped moving. He stepped out, only to discover that the raging waters had washed his home all the way to Tauangan, a sitio about nine kilometers away.      When the adrenaline rush subsided, Dela Cruz felt pain in his right foot and saw a four- to five-inch nail piercing his shin.        INJURY. Dela Cruz miraculously suffered only two minor injuries while he was inside his bamboo hut as it was washed away by Odette's flood: one caused by a four- to five-inch nail that pierced his shin and another caused by a piece of a roof that wounded his foot. Photos by Reymund Titong/Rappler       ""I was lucky because I survived. A lot of people died because of Odette. If I had left my house, I'd probably have died back then,"" Dela Cruz said in Hiligaynon.       Dela Cruz lives in Kalatong, a low-lying area where the tributary rivers of Cabadiangan and Kalatong merge with the Sipalay River, about 900 kilometers south of Manila. Kalatong is located in Cabadiangan, the village with the highest death toll in Sipalay City, Negros Occidental, during Odette.       Months of analysis by Rappler unpacked who the most exposed to natural hazards in Negros Occidental are. This is among the provinces in the Philippines with the highest exposure to multiple hazards and risks.       The investigation also looked at whose houses are most at risk of being washed away, which evacuation centers across the province are most likely to keep people safe, and which ones might put people in greater danger. In the second part of this investigation, Rappler explored what the local government is doing about these.        WHERE RIVERS MEET. Kalatong was submerged in deep floods in the evening when Odette hit Sipalay - where the Kalatong, Cabadiangan, and Sipalay rivers converge. Photo by Reymund Titong/Rappler       Odette made landfall  nine times  from December 16 to 17, 2021, as it made its way through southern and central Philippines. It left massive destruction in different parts of all island groups in the Philippines, destroying homes, damaging roads and bridges, and toppling communication and power lines.      According to then-United Nations representative to the Philippines Gustavo Gonzalez, Odette was the  second deadliest disaster  to hit the globe in 2021, next to the magnitude 7.2  earthquake  in Haiti.       Gonzalez said the damage caused by the typhoon was ""comparable"" to that caused by  Super Typhoon Yolanda  (Haiyan), one of the most powerful typhoons in history. Though the magnitudes of the storms were impossible to measure and compare exactly, the number of people who were vulnerable to such disasters was not.       People in peril       Dela Cruz's almost biblical story of survival was just one among the hundreds of thousands of stories of Negrosanons who were affected by flooding caused by Odette. According to  data  from the Office of Civil Defense, a total of 1.5 million Negrosanons were affected by the typhoon, and government maps show that many of them were at risk.

According to our analysis, one out of every seven people in Sipalay City, where Dela Cruz lives, resides in areas at high risk of flooding. A quarter of them are children younger than 10 years old.       Houses at risk      Despite the availability of official data identifying risks of flooding, this has not translated to the construction of flood-resistant houses.

Critical facilities in danger       In the Philippines, it's rare to find evacuation centers used exclusively for disasters.

In the whole of Negros Occidental, there are only five evacuation centers, three of which are located in high-risk areas. In Sipalay, there are none; instead, the city's health centers, government buildings, and schools double as evacuation centers during these perilous times.

We know that the flood will reach the area where we are evacuated because our place is really prone to flooding. Barangay V is located in a low-lying area.""      ""Typhoons hit us only a few times, but when it happens, there's a high chance that we will get flooded,"" she added.      After Odette, Sipalay officials have asked residents living near Kalatong River like Dela Cruz to move to higher ground.      The city government also said it plans to relocate some of the schools out of flood zones. Experts warn that it would not be an easy task.       As for Sipalay City National High School, officials said it would also be moved to a different location due to land ownership issues - and not because of the flood risk.      In March 2023, the House of Representatives passed on third and final reading a  bill  that seeks to mandate the establishment of permanent evacuation centers in every city and municipality. If passed into law, this pivotal legislation would provide Filipinos a crucial lifeline during times of disaster.

Interviews in Hiligaynon were translated by Reymund Titong for Rappler.        This story was produced under the Environmental Data Journalism Academy, with support from Internews' Earth Journalism Network and Thibi.co.        Methodology        The locations of schools and health facilities were sourced from  HazardHunterPH , while the locations of evacuation centers were from the  Office of Civil Defense . Flood susceptibility shapefiles were sourced from the Mines and Geosciences Bureau. Each facility was categorized as being in a low, medium, high, or very high flood susceptibility zone by finding the intersection between the facility's location and a polygon in the flood susceptibility shapefile in QGIS.        Disaster Risk Reduction and Management spending data of local government units (LGUs) in Negros Occidental were sourced from the  Commission on Audit . Poverty incidence rates of Negros Occidental LGUs were from the  Philippine Statistics Authority . The report also used the  Housing Vulnerability Index , which was provided to the Academy by Aaron Opdyke, senior lecturer at The University of Sydney School of Civil Engineering.        Anecdotes of Sipalay residents during Typhoon Odette and insights of Sipalay LGU officials were gathered from interviews with communities in Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. Other information on Typhoon Odette and hazard maps were corroborated through desk research.   ",Negative

2629187,free-to-disagree-despicable-broadcasters-who-interviewed-abused-child,"[Free to disagree] Patiño and Tabar: Dim, deviant or despicable?","
<p>For most of my professional life I have been giving free counseling services to victims of sexual violence. My patients have been mostly women, but children have also been referred to me.</p>



<p>My counseling work in this area began in 1988 when I became the Secretary of the Board of the first-ever rape and crisis center for women in the Philippines, the Women’s Crisis Center. I recall how, when our volunteers accompanied victims to the police stations, everybody and their uncle would enter the interviewing room once it was known that the complaint was rape.</p>



<p>For the decades I have been a counselor, I have had to discipline media (local and sometimes foreign) who, for some reason, think that I would do the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>reveal someone in my patient list to them by asking any patient of mine if they were willing to be interviewed or; </li>



<li>agree to see the victim and hold my therapeutic session as the cameras rolled. Apparently, these people think that should the victim consent, this would satisfy ethical requirements.</li>
</ul>



<p>Uh, no. Perhaps it satisfies their cheap conceptions of ethics but such “consent”&nbsp; does not satisfy my ethical standards. I really would have to be some kind of narcissist to agree to the kind of shameless self-promotion of having my first patient session filmed before I could even assess what the problem is. As well,&nbsp; I cannot for the life of me consider how I might ask any patient of mine whether she would like to talk to the media. Knowing the power dynamics between doctor and patient, there is no way I can ensure that this suggestion will not be taken as a recommendation towards healing, thus countermanding informed consent.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-rarely-helpful"">Rarely helpful</h5>



<p>In my experience, media exposure is rarely helpful and quite often detrimental. </p>



<p>I have occasionally agreed with a patient to have their story documented by the media. I have done so reluctantly, often after a thorough discussion, and only after I am assured this is the patient’s will. In fact, I left a well-known women’s organization long ago, partly because their formula for handling cases seems to go too often to the path of protests and victims “breaking the silence”. </p>



<p>In my experience, seeking justice, even filing criminal cases, need not be accompanied by a media circus. Indeed, when it is accompanied by such a circus, the victim takes a much longer time to heal or the healing is never as complete.</p>



<p>I have a somewhat paranoid suspicion that the foreign (mostly Western) journalists are guilty of racism, thinking that they can cajole some psychologist into agreeing to their suggested shenanigans. Perhaps their contacts here in the Philippines put them up to it.</p>



<p>Like Dennes Tabar and Juril Patiño maybe?</p>

<p>Brigada News FM Cebu broadcasters Patiño and Tabor have <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/hontiveros-call-government-probe-interview-rape-survivor-cebu/?cx_testId=2&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_1&amp;cx_artPos=0&amp;cx_experienceId=EX4CPN0G1RJL#cxrecs_s"">gained notoriety</a> recently because of what can only be described as a “dumb as a sack of rocks” of interviewing a 4- year-old girl about her rape on their radio program. Reports state that Brigada News reporter Jonalyn Jumabis facilitated the interview from within the police station where the child was in protective custody.</p>



<p>I almost did not write this opinion piece out of a sense of nationalism, that something like this could lead outsiders to think that we are a poorly educated, low-rent, third-world country. But given the quickness by which professional associations of journalists like the <em>Kapisanan ng Mga Brodkasters ng Pilipinas</em> in Cebu, The Stet, Cebu Women in Media  and the National Union of Journalists in the Philippines condemned the actions of Patiño and Tabar, it is obvious to me the the two were in some no-think zone. I suppose they thought they had a scoop. What they had was a large scoop of ordure.</p>



<p>Obviously we need to ask where these two got their sexuality education, whether they went to journalism school, or whether they really got any real education at all. </p>



<p>As it turns out, Patiño is a lawyer and Tabar is a former barangay captain. </p>



<p>It seems they fell through the cracks of their schools’ educational standards. Education is about transmitting technical and scientific knowledge but also about transmitting values such as current ethical standards of the discipline or profession.</p>



<p>In the early days of this travesty, both broadcasters were reported to be unremorseful. One of their justifications was that they only did the interview in all its graphic detail in order to help strengthen the case. Patiño seems to have ignored the law on protecting children victims of abuse against interviews like the type he undertook. He also seems to be proposing a legal theory that sensationalist media exposure strengthens the merits of a case. Even if I am a lay person, I did not bother to run that by friends who are in the legal profession. I did not want to get unfriended.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-deviant"">Deviant</h5>



<p>As I am an educator, I will give whatever schools produced Patiño and Tabar the benefit of the doubt. So I will assume they taught Patiño the basics, like lawyers should know the law. I will assume that Tabar was taught things like broadcasters have to abide by the law and to look up the ethical standards of journalism.  If we grant they know the law and standards, this would mean Patiño and Tabar understand that you do not re-traumatize a four year old by interviewing for the purposes of generating content. </p>



<p>Why did Patiño and Tabar do it? If it wasn’t for viewership as these two “broadcasters” insist, and it is illogical to believe their claim that they wanted strengthen the case,  was it because they thought somehow it was worthwhile or even enjoyable?</p>



<p>The egregiousness of the interview is such that “dumb” may be the kindest interpretation we can have of these two.</p>



<p>Because for those who heard the interview, it sounded like the interviewers were happy about the graphic descriptions they evoked from the child. Not having examined the two professionally, I cannot tell whether their erotic proclivities tend toward the criminal. But the fact that they thought this line of questioning would be acceptable, tells us about a culture that socializes men towards sexual violence, abuse and criminality.</p>



<p>For all the progress we have made as evidenced by laws and professional standards, there is still leeway for supposedly educated men to do something as repulsive as what these two did.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-despicable"">Despicable</h5>



<p>Whether they undertook the interview out of a scarcity of intellect or a surfeit of unhealthy eroticism, I do not know. I am open to other reasons for their behavior, though only these two options arise from my attempts at understanding.</p>



<p>What I am sure of is that I find these two despicable. They re-traumatized a 4-year-old with nary a thought that perhaps there was something wrong.</p>



<p>When called to account they showed no remorse at first.&nbsp; Later a statement of partial remorse was made on their behalf by Brigada News, the radio station they work for. But I could find no apologies from the two.</p>



<p>This is clearly a situation where external agencies must step in order to extract justice and restitution.</p>



<p>I join the call for a full, written apology from Patiño and Tabar.&nbsp; Tabar’s broadcasting license should be revoked as well as his memberships in the professional organizations. As for Patiño, I hope the Integrated Bar of the Philippines investigates him and metes out punishment. I join the Dumanjug police station in calling for charges to be filed against them.</p>



<p>The child they abused should be given psychosocial support and I suggest Patiño, Tabar and Brigada News FM Cebu be made to pay for her counseling and other needs. I suggest further that other significant others like the aunt and mother of the child undergo therapy as a first step.</p>



<p>I also hope the child’s rapist is brought to justice.</p>



<p>There are many layers and aspects in the fight to free society of abuse and violence against women and children. One of the effective measures is the prosecution of perpetrators by the associations that regulate professionals, the regulatory bodies that discipline industries and institutions, and by the courts who must bring those who break the law to justice. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the step-by-step process.</p>



<p>First, go to the nearest PSA regional or provincial offices. Parents can also go to malls or local government unit registration centers. The parent or guardian must be registered with PhilSys first.</p>



<p>Registration centers are open to walk-in registrations.  Filipinos can also take advantage of PSA&#8217;s mobile registration activities for Geographically-Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas (GIDAs) or for those who have no means to visit any registration centers.</p>



<p>Present any of the following supporting documents:</p>



<ul>
<li>Certificate of Live Birth issued by the PSA or the Local Civil Registry Office (LCRO)</li>



<li>Report of Birth issued by the PSA or Philippine Foreign Service Post </li>



<li>Certificate of Foundling issued by the PSA</li>



<li>Certificate of Foundling or Certificate of Live Birth or Persons with No Known Parent/s issued by the PSA</li>



<li>Municipal Form No. 102</li>



<li>Philippine Passport or ePassport issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs</li>



<li>Any document showing the full name of the child, date and place of birth, the full name of the mother, and the full name of the father, if acknowledged</li>
</ul>



<p>The PhilSys Number (PSN) or permanent identification number of the child that will be generated will be linked to the accompanying parent or guardian.</p>



<p>After the PSA personnel validates the information of the child, the front-facing photograph of the child will be captured. When the child reaches the age of five, the child&#8217;s complete biometric information be captured, including the fingerprints, iris scan, and the updated front-facing photograph.</p>



<p>For children aged 5 and above, the PSA said registration activities are also conducted in schools to register students.</p>



<p>Registration services are also provided to Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) beneficiaries and their children during Family Development Sessions. </p>



<p>The PSA said over 84.7 million Filipinos have registered in PhilSys as of March 2024. – <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>MANILA, Philippines – Three students from De La Salle University Manila (DLSU) won a P1-million grant after topping a <a href=""https://firstgencodegreen.com/register"">competition</a> for innovative solutions to curb campus emissions, sponsored by Lopez-owned First Gen Corporation.</p>



<p>Engineering student Fernando Magallanes, organizational communication student Alexia Roman, and economics student Ralph Stephen Saavedra designed a compact anaerobic digester system that will convert cafeteria food waste to biogas.</p>



<p>Saavedra said their team was inspired by existing anaerobic digestion tanks used in large farms. &#8220;We tried to create a scaled-down version of it with numerous key modifications to make it indoor-compatible, safe, and reliable,&#8221; told Rappler in a message. </p>



<p>He said the team is also working on a variant of the design that can be used in hospitality establishments and restaurants. </p>



<p>The million-peso grant will be used to install digesters in three cafeterias of the Manila campus, as well as in the Laguna campus, according to Roman. Each student is also set to receive P100,000 individually.</p>

<p>Every year, DLSU’s cafeterias produce over 28,000 kilograms of kitchen waste, and are responsible for 480,000 kilograms of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a release from First Gen.</p>



<p>The technology is both an economic and environmental solution, as waste increases over time, and poor waste management causes pollution and contaminates the environment. Food loss and waste <a href=""https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/what-you-need-know-about-combatting-food-loss-and-waste"">account</a> for 8% to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to research by the lntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>



<p>&#8220;The technology to utilize organic waste as a source of flammable cooking fuel, electricity, and  compost already exists, but is yet to be thoroughly explored and implemented here in the Philippines,&#8221; said Saavedra. </p>

2627915,profile-anya-alindada-journey-international-ballet-scene-filipina,The Filipina ballerina: Anya Alindada on her journey in the international ballet scene,"
<p>When asked what it was about ballet that made her fall in love with it at four years old, Anya Nicole Alindada said it was “a bit of everything.”  </p>



<p>“The costumes, the music, the pirouetting and jetéing across the stage, and the fact that they were able to stand on the tips of their toes. I loved that they were able to tell a story through dance, and I wanted to do that, too,” she told Rappler in an interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anya recalled in a <a href=""https://www.anyaballerina.com/post/where-the-journey-begins"">blog post</a> that she had already wanted to do the more advanced barre exercises even as a four-year-old. It even reached the point that she quit looking for a ballet school in Metro Manila because she felt like the lessons were too basic, or her teachers too grumpy.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until when she was seven and watching a flamenco performance at Julie Borromeo’s Performing Arts Foundation that Anya felt like pursuing dance again. While she enjoyed the flamenco lessons, she was advised by a teacher to take ballet lessons to fix her turnout and feet. Anya said that she was initially against this given her past experiences, but after she gave in, Anya fell harder for ballet the second time around. </p>



<p>“I think I just really enjoyed being on the stage and performing for an audience. Every time I stepped on a stage, it felt like I belonged there. Not dancing was never an option I saw growing up, and maybe that’s when I knew that dancing was what I wanted my life to be,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-becoming-a-ballerina"">Becoming a ballerina</h5>



<p>Growing up, Anya had been homeschooled. “My parents and I didn’t know it at the time, but it was one of the things that helped me pursue my dream,” she said. She would often bring her school work with her to dance studios. And while there were times that she would wonder what it was like going to regular school, she thought that she wasn&#8217;t really missing out on much since she also had friends from dance studios and homeschooling groups. </p>



<p>From the ages of seven to 14, Anya studied all different forms of dance — jazz, tap, flamenco, hip-hop, musical theater, and even hula — at Julie Borromeo’s. Her ballet lessons were four sessions a week, each around 1.5 hours. </p>



<p><strong>“</strong>I can’t remember the exact reason why I chose to pursue ballet professionally. But I remember always asking my parents for more lessons. I wanted to be in the studio as much as I could, and after class would finish, I always felt that I wanted more,” she told Rappler.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In August 2019, she purposely selected the Japan Grand Prix to be her first competition abroad. There, they got to attend a five-day masterclass by the artistic directors of the best US and European ballet schools. It was there that Anya realized how advanced the international ballet industry was. </p>



<p>She returned to the Philippines unsure of how she could move forward. “I prayed and asked for God’s help because I could not get the equivalent level of training that I needed in the Philippines,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, her mom saw a post about a three-day European Masters Intensive that was being held at the Melbourne Academy of the Arts (MAARTS) in Australia in October 2019. MAARTS Artistic Directress Jamina Stefkovski would soon offer her a scholarship for their Full-Time Training program. </p>



<p>Since her parents knew how much she wanted to pursue advanced ballet, Anya was allowed to move to Melbourne on her own at the age of 15. </p>



<p>“Being exposed to ballet outside the Philippines was very eye-opening. After seeing all the extremely talented Japanese dancers, some as young as 10, I realized that I was far behind in terms of skill,” Anya said. She also recalled that while she was told that she had potential when she was offered a spot in MAARTS, she knew that she still “had a lot of work to do to get where [she] wanted to be.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In MAARTS, she spent one and a half years training for international online competitions and auditioning for top schools around the world. She was accepted into summer programs at the Paris Opera, Houston Ballet, and American Ballet Theater, and won awards at select competitions, including the Italian competition Salieri Danza where she was given the opportunity to skip the first round of auditions and go straight to the final round for the English National Ballet School’s (ENBS) three-year full-time course. </p>



<p>After submitting her final audition there, Anya soon learned that she had been hand-picked to join by ENBS Directress and Principal Dancer of the Royal Ballet Company Viviana Durante. The Filipina teen was one of only 30 students accepted to the program. </p>

<p>The good news kept pouring as she was also accelerated into the second year of the three-year program, and was granted 80% of each year’s tuition (£19,000 or P1.35 million) for free. She was the first ballerina from the Philippines who qualified for this opportunity in ENBS’ 35-year history. </p>



<p>In July 2023, Anya graduated from ENBS at the age of 19.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-anya-s-next-big-stage"">Anya&#8217;s next big stage</h5>



<p>It’s been four years since Anya left the Philippines but she admits that there are still instances where everything feels surreal to her. </p>



<p>“I think my entire experience as a whole has just been unbelievable. I believe God was the one who opened up all these amazing doors for me because I had truly no idea at the time how I would be able to achieve my dreams of studying abroad,” she told Rappler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While she acknowledges that the local scene has significantly improved compared to when she was younger, Anya shared that she still thinks ballet is a very underappreciated art form in the Philippines. </p>



<p>“Growing up, and even up to now, I don’t think any schools in the Philippines offer full-time ballet training like I received abroad,” she said. “I didn’t even know that dancing all day every day was a thing. In London, kids from a young age who already know they want to dance have that option and opportunity to do so. With the training I received abroad, I would get around five to six hours a day, six days a week.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She also added that being exposed to international practices could help widen an artist’s craft. “I think in order to grow as a dancer, one has to be exposed to as many different teachers and styles of teaching as one can. It’s being able to learn and adapt to whatever the teacher/choreographer wants that makes a good dancer,” she said. </p>



<p>While many Filipino ballet dancers dream of furthering their craft by attending international schools, Anya noted that the Philippines is also lacking in a clear pathway to pursuing studies abroad. </p>



<p>She recognized as well that ballet can be seen as something very expensive. It was fortunate that in her previous school in the Philippines, many scholars had been given the chance to train for free. And when she started exploring the international ballet scene, grants and scholarships were also of big help to her. </p>



<p>“There have only been a handful of Filipinos in my generation that have made it abroad, and when I had wanted to do the same, I had no one I knew that I could look to for help or advice. But hopefully, through my journey, other Filipinos can see that it is possible. I am so grateful and honored to have been the first Filipina to graduate from ENBS, but I also truly hope I won’t be the last,” she said. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-challenges"">Challenges</h5>



<p>Anya’s journey, though, has also had its fair share of challenges. In November 2022, she was first diagnosed with bone stress in her shins. Because of this, she had to lessen her participation in auditions as she had to rest. She also missed the opportunity to join the English National Ballet company in their 22/23 and 23/24 <em>Nutcracker</em> seasons as she had a shin fracture in her left shin. Despite being devastated that she missed the opportunity, Anya said she was determined to let her shin recover fully instead. </p>



<p>“The ballet world is a very unpredictable one,” Anya said about the whole ordeal. She would like to stay in London for the next two to three years, but it would primarily depend on getting a job. “[I hope] to find a company that I love, dance as much as I can, and hopefully rise through the ranks,” she said, noting that just like every other dancer, she also dreams of being awarded the position of Principal Dancer. </p>

<p>When asked if she would like to return to the Philippines, Anya said that she would like to explore her career options first abroad. “But I am open to the idea of visiting every once in a while to perform if I were to be invited. Ultimately, at the end of my career, I do want to return home and create a school that can offer the training I received abroad to other aspiring Filipino dancers who want to make this their life as I did,” she said. </p>



<p>As for her advice to aspiring Filipino dancers, Anya said that they should “not be afraid and to have faith.” </p>



<p>“If ballet is something you truly want to do, first of all, don’t be afraid to admit it. Second, don’t be afraid to do whatever it takes to achieve it,” she added. – <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

""The costumes, the music, the pirouetting and jeteing across the stage, and the fact that they were able to stand on the tips of their toes. I loved that they were able to tell a story through dance, and I wanted to do that, too,"" she told Rappler in an interview.       Anya recalled in a  blog post  that she had already wanted to do the more advanced barre exercises even as a four-year-old. It even reached the point that she quit looking for a ballet school in Metro Manila because she felt like the lessons were too basic, or her teachers too grumpy.             .igframe iframe{ background: white;  max-width: 540px;  width: calc(100% - 2px);  border-radius: 3px;  border: 1px solid rgb(219, 219, 219);  box-shadow: none;  display: block;  margin: 0px 0px 12px;  min-width: 326px;  padding: 0px; height: 967px; } @media screen and (max-width: 760px){ .igframe iframe{ height: 710px; }u }             It wasn't until when she was seven and watching a flamenco performance at Julie Borromeo's Performing Arts Foundation that Anya felt like pursuing dance again. While she enjoyed the flamenco lessons, she was advised by a teacher to take ballet lessons to fix her turnout and feet. Anya said that she was initially against this given her past experiences, but after she gave in, Anya fell harder for ballet the second time around.       ""I think I just really enjoyed being on the stage and performing for an audience. Every time I stepped on a stage, it felt like I belonged there. Not dancing was never an option I saw growing up, and maybe that's when I knew that dancing was what I wanted my life to be,"" she said.       Becoming a ballerina      Growing up, Anya had been homeschooled. ""My parents and I didn't know it at the time, but it was one of the things that helped me pursue my dream,"" she said. She would often bring her school work with her to dance studios. And while there were times that she would wonder what it was like going to regular school, she thought that she wasn't really missing out on much since she also had friends from dance studios and homeschooling groups.       From the ages of seven to 14, Anya studied all different forms of dance -- jazz, tap, flamenco, hip-hop, musical theater, and even hula -- at Julie Borromeo's. Her ballet lessons were four sessions a week, each around 1.5 hours.        "" I can't remember the exact reason why I chose to pursue ballet professionally. But I remember always asking my parents for more lessons. I wanted to be in the studio as much as I could, and after class would finish, I always felt that I wanted more,"" she told Rappler.              .igframe iframe{ background: white;  max-width: 540px;  width: calc(100% - 2px);  border-radius: 3px;  border: 1px solid rgb(219, 219, 219);  box-shadow: none;  display: block;  margin: 0px 0px 12px;  min-width: 326px;  padding: 0px; height: 967px; } @media screen and (max-width: 760px){ .igframe iframe{ height: 710px; }u }             In August 2019, she purposely selected the Japan Grand Prix to be her first competition abroad.

2627659,opinion-urgent-appeal-amend-gcta-law,[OPINION] An urgent appeal to amend the GCTA law,"
<p>The Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) Law, enacted through Republic Act 10592 in 2013, aimed to promote the rehabilitation of Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDLs) by reducing their length of stay if they manifest good behavior while serving their prison sentence. It also was envisioned by Congress to be a mechanism to lessen prison congestion and to reduce the cost of running prisons.</p>



<p>Given the state of prison conditions in the Philippines in 2013, where it was characterized by prison crowding, long prison sentences even for low level drug users, lack of resources and personnel&#8211; and the ensuing reliance on the&nbsp;<em>pangkat</em>&nbsp;(gang) and&nbsp;<em>mayores</em>&nbsp;(inmate leadership) to keep the system afloat, this law was indeed envisioned to be revolutionary.</p>



<p>More than a decade after the passage of the law, we should have now reaped the benefits – more reformed PDLs, less crowding, less prison violence, and more efficient jail and prison systems.</p>



<p>Yet, these targeted outcomes have not yet been realized. Our prison system has, in fact, become <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-drug-arrest-jail-prison-congestion-search-alternatives/"">more congested than ever</a>. And running our prisons and jails have become costlier. This is made worse by the lingering effects of the War on Drugs implemented by the previous president, where 70 percent of the PDLs are serving time for drug offenses, many of whom are in for life imprisonment.</p>



<p>While there are many organizational and cultural factors that limited the full potential of the GCTA law, one simple yet glaring reason was how the law was worded. It lacked specificity. </p>



<p>The law says, &#8220;Art. 99. Who grants time allowances. – Whenever lawfully justified, the Director of the Bureau of Corrections, the Chief of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology and/or the Warden of a provincial, district, municipal or city jail shall grant allowance for good conduct.&#8221;</p>



<p>The law did not include Prison Superintendents of the seven prison facilities of the Bureau of Corrections, including&nbsp; the biggest mega prison complex in the world, the New Bilibid Prison.&nbsp; This is a very unfortunate omission considering that the GCTA law is specially designed for convicted prisoners. While convicted prisoners can avail of the GCTA, it will be only through the Director General of the Bureau of Corrections, which at the current situation of having 50,000 PDLs nationwide, becomes an overwhelming task for the office.</p>



<p>Additionally, while Wardens of the BJMP jails, like municipal jails with inmates of less than 100, and where the Warden has a rank of a Senior Jail Officer 1 (SJO1) who is a sergeant, can grant GCTA credits, the Superintendent in the New Bilibid Prisons, with a PDL population of almost 30,000 and with a rank of at least a colonel,&nbsp;CANNOT&nbsp;grant a GCTA.</p>



<p>The lack of power to grant GCTA among the Prison Superintendents has delayed the granting of GCTA to truly deserving PDLs. It has affected and continues to affect 50,000 PDLs nationwide.</p>



<p>Interviews with legislative staff who crafted this law said that this was due to apprehensions that BuCor officials may abuse their authority. In 2013, the BuCor was plagued with issues of drug dealing, gang violence and contraband proliferation and Congress limited the granting of GCTA to the BuCor Director General. Indeed, in 2019, the &#8220;GCTA for sale&#8221; controversy erupted when former Calauan, Laguna Mayor Antonio Sanchez was released early. While the subsequent Congressional Inquiry did not find any anomalous actions by the BuCor officials, it nevertheless created an impression that BuCor personnel were easily corrupted by the power to grant early releases.</p>



<p>The current BuCor leadership is trying its very best to expedite the grant of the GCTA by forming multiple committees that assess the behavior of the PDLs. And the Director General had instituted many organizational and cultural reforms to streamline and legitimize the awarding of the GCTA. There are checks and balances introduced to make the granting of GCTA transparent and corrupt-free.</p>



<p>Still, the process would be expedited if the GCTA law is amended. It should be a simple tweak. </p>



<p>It must read, &#8220;Art. 99. Who grants time allowances. – Whenever lawfully justified, the Director of the Bureau of Corrections, the Chief of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology and/or the SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PRISON AND PENAL FARMS, Warden of a provincial, district, municipal or city jail shall grant allowance for good conduct.&#8221;</p>



<p>If this amendment is made, I estimate that at least 1,000 behaving inmates will be released early by at least a year. This will translate to government savings of at least P25 million a year. This savings should be enough to construct new schools annually. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

And the Director General had instituted many organizational and cultural reforms to streamline and legitimize the awarding of the GCTA. There are checks and balances introduced to make the granting of GCTA transparent and corrupt-free.      Still, the process would be expedited if the GCTA law is amended. It should be a simple tweak.       It must read, ""Art. 99. Who grants time allowances. - Whenever lawfully justified, the Director of the Bureau of Corrections, the Chief of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology and/or the SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PRISON AND PENAL FARMS, Warden of a provincial, district, municipal or city jail shall grant allowance for good conduct.""      If this amendment is made, I estimate that at least 1,000 behaving inmates will be released early by at least a year. This will translate to government savings of at least P25 million a year. This savings should be enough to construct new schools annually.  - Rappler.com        Raymund E.

<p>MANILA, Philippines – Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte, who once <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-crime-of-sara-duterte/"">punched a court sheriff</a> in a fit of rage when she was mayor of Davao City, advised teachers on Thursday, March 21, to pause when they are about to lose their cool while conducting their classes. </p>



<p>The Vice President made the statement when asked about her reaction to a viral video of a teacher berating her students live on TikTok.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Ang una kong naging reaksiyon ay tao lang &#8216;yung teacher. Lahat tayo umaabot sa punto na nagagalit tayo lalo kapag na fru-frustrate tayo,</em>&#8221; Duterte told reporters in an <a href=""https://twitter.com/News5PH/status/1770697500091207729"">ambush interview</a> in Cambodia. </p>



<p>(My first reaction was &#8211; the teacher is just a human. We all reach a point where we get angry especially when we&#8217;e frustrated.)</p>



<p>She said no penalties were imposed on the teacher, but added that she would be reprimanded by her regional director.</p>



<p>&#8220;I saw her explanation. And then, I instructed the regional office that there will be no penalties for the teacher. Just to remind the teacher, if she’s angry, she has to pause. Pause the class. If she’s not angry anymore, she can resume the class. There’s a need to pause, if the teacher is angry,&#8221; Duterte said in a mix of English and Filipino. </p>



<p>Duterte&#8217;s Zen-like advice was a stark contrast to her throwing a tantrum and punching a&nbsp;Davao Regional Trial Court&nbsp;sheriff during a demolition of houses over a decade ago in Davao City when she was mayor.</p>



<p>The Department of Education (DepEd) said on Monday, March 18, it issued a show cause order to the erring teacher. </p>



<p>According to DepEd order No. 40 series of 2012, child abuse in schools includes an &#8220;act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Vice President said that teachers are trained for psychosocial support. Students who felt anxious and stressed about the incident will undergo debriefing sessions.</p>



<p>The DepEd has identified bullying as one of the reasons for the prevailing learning crisis and one of the factors why the Philippines performed poorly in global education assessment.<strong> – Rappler.com</strong><br></p>

2625747,what-will-it-take-to-produce-southeast-asia-first-triple-a-game,What will it take to produce Southeast Asia’s first triple-A video game?,"
<p>High-impact, high-quality, and high-budget – AAA games are the darling of major gaming publishers, hooking a global player base and raking a chunk of the worldwide US<a href=""https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/video-games-in-2023-the-year-in-numbers"">$184-billion</a> gaming revenue generated in 2023.</p>



<p>For Mufizal Mokhtar, general manager of Virtuos KL and art director of hugely successful titles including <em>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</em>, the creation of the first homegrown AAA title from Southeast Asia can inspire the emergence of major studios from the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But that’s just a vision,” he says, “The plan is, number one, to make people understand that this is a serious industry.”</p>



<p>The seriousness of gaming is backed by its economic weight. A <a href=""https://nikopartners.com/sea6-games-market-reports/#:~:text=Southeast%20Asia%20is%20emerging%20as,%2C%20infrastructure%20providers%2C%20and%20investors."">report</a> from Niko Partners, a market intelligence firm focused on the Asian and Middle Eastern gaming industry, estimated US$5.8 billion in Southeast Asian video game revenue last year. This number is projected to reach upwards of US$7.2 billion by 2027. In the Philippines, <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/6720/online-gaming-philippines/#topicOverview"">the growth of players</a> largely stems from the rising accessibility of mobile phones and internet services.</p>



<p>The Philippine government has shown its support through the years – from <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/191771-ph-esports-achievements-yearend-2017/"">allowing professional esports players to secure athletic licenses</a> to the Department of Trade and Industries kickstarting the country’s first GameDev summit in February 2024. The summit, conducted last February 15, was attended by <a href=""https://www.dti.gov.ph/news/dti-supports-the-first-gamedev-summit-in-the-philippines/"">participants and companies from 32 countries</a>.<br><br>According to Mokhtar, summits provide a platform in which game developers can foster new connections and find solutions to move forward as an industry.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve got Indonesia, who&#8217;s a powerhouse in art and animation. We&#8217;ve got the Philippines, also a powerhouse in art and animation. We’ve got Vietnam. We&#8217;ve got Kuala Lumpur. We&#8217;ve got Singapore, Japan. We&#8217;ve got a lot of talents over here. We need to figure out how to come together and create something that is resounding in the industry.”</p>



<p>For him, utilizing the strengths of Southeast Asia can help realize its remaining growth potential. A synergistic team will be invaluable in achieving the goal of a local triple-A title.</p>



<p>“There are more players playing, there are more developers developing and there are more people tackling bigger and bigger and more expensive games. So the growth potential is definitely there, [but] there are some challenges that we still need to look at, for example, understanding cultural differences between Western and Eastern developers,” says Mokhtar.</p>



<p>He zeroed in on Asian cultures placing emphasis on respecting authority and the elderly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sometimes, people don’t voice out their opinions to their superiors,” he says, “That gap is slowly closing because we see a lot of cross-pollination of talents coming from the West and cross-pollination of talents coming from the East, and the world is getting a lot smaller and smaller.”</p>



<p>Mokhtar also talks of the importance of governments and companies investing in “unpolished gems” – what he calls “raw” talent.&nbsp; These are game developers with high skills who do not have the opportunity nor the exposure to shine in the local game development scene.</p>



<p>“The industry needs to invest in schools, indirectly investing in talents, so that they have the right education, they have the right exposure to the right tool sets for them to learn the right fundamentals.” He is a manager at Virtuos Kuala Lumpur, which works closely with schools to upgrade their curriculum and technologies to align with industry requirements.</p>



<p>Public and private investment will not only result in better games but also improved technology across the board. <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-economic-impact-gaming-balancing-innovation-regulation/"">Gaming has historically pushed the development of graphics processing, which has found applications in medical imaging and virtual reality.</a> Even <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/2023-reports-studies-generative-ai-disinformation-concerns-social-media/"">generative AI</a>, mentions Mokhtar, would not have been possible without the impact of the gaming industry in graphics.</p>



<p>“We make games for people, for people to have fun, but the work involved in creating those games is serious work.” He says, “There are a lot of thoughts that go into it. The amount of brain power that goes into making a game is probably not that far off from people trying to launch a rocket, for example. So what we need to do is we need to start creating teams that can work together.”<br><br>“Creating a complete cycle games team is the path into creating a major triple-A title coming from Southeast Asia.”</p>



<p>This game, according to him, does not have to be original. It could be a remake or remaster of an already existing title. It is his vision for the short term.</p>



<p>“For the far future, I would love to see big studios emerging from Southeast Asia, multiple big studios emerging from Southeast Asia.

<p>PAMPANGA, Philippines – Khan Academy Philippines (Khan PH) partnered with Apl.de.Ap Foundation International (APLFI) and Accenture Philppines to support the digital transformation in education of Sapang Bato National High School (SBNHS) in Angeles City to prepare its students for 21st century work. </p>



<p>The partnership between these companies coincided with US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo’s trade mission in the country from March 11-12, 2024. </p>



<p>Khan Academy platform will offer learning sessions on computer programming for free and will provide certificates of completion for skills mastery in computing. Meanwhile, Accenture will donate laptops and also provide coding and other digital skilling programs to the school through Accenture’s <a href=""https://s2sacademy.ph/"">Skills to Succeed Academy</a> which was launched in the Philippines in 2018.</p>



<p>Among the objectives of Raimondo&#8217;s trade mission to the country was to bring job prospects from US-based companies to the Philippines. It also focused on how American technology could upskill Filipino workers in the field of computer programming.</p>



<p>“Khan Academy is an online platform. It&#8217;s easy enough for anyone to just log in to our website to access all the materials,” Khan PH executive director Denise Fabella told Rappler on Tuesday, March 19.</p>



<p>“(Though this) was a collaborative event for Khan Academy Philippines, Apl.de.Ap Foundation, and Accenture. We are open to working with different organizations to help support other schools,” she added.</p>



<p>Abdon Aguilar, SBNHS principal, said the project would benefit 1,664 students. </p>

<p>“Our students as well as our teachers can now access online platforms for free that they can use in their English, Math, and Science subjects. The free educational upskill programs will help students reach greater opportunities in the future,” Aguilar told Rappler in Kapampangan.</p>



<p>“Khan Academy will provide the online platform, Accenture donated the second hand laptops, while APLFI will provide our school with the internet connection,” he added.</p>



<p>SBNHS consists of 1,202 junior high school and 462 senior high school students in its 30-room campus. It is also known as the “school with golden opportunities.”</p>



<p>“Definitely this has a big impact in our lessons especially to our teachers as it becomes easier and more interactive especially since they are 21st century learners. That&#8217;s why they provided educational technology as a preparation for their future,” Aguilar said.</p>



<p>An initial batch of 50 preowned Hewlett Packard laptops were given to SBNHS S during a handover ceremony on March 18. </p>



<p>Khan PH was founded by Geraldine Acuña-Sunshine. She is the first Filipino to serve as one of the governing boards at Harvard University. She is a corporate lawyer, community builder, and social impact entrepreneur. Sunshine is also the president of the Philippine Living Heritage Initiative whose mission is to deepen Filipino identity through education across the global Filipino diaspora.</p>



<p>APLFI is a non-profit organization founded by Filipino-American Grammy award-winning musical artist Allan Pineda Lindo, known as Apl.de.Ap of the Black Eyed Peas. APLFI has been supporting SBNHS since 2019, as Sapang Bato is the artist’s birthplace. His mom and relatives still reside there.</p>



<p>“As APLFI&#8217;s founder, I&#8217;m thrilled to bring Khan Academy, a global education pioneer, to the Philippines through our partnership with Khan PH and Accenture. This move not only highlights our commitment to excellence in education for my hometown and beyond but ensures that Filipinos are prepared to meet global standards. Together, we&#8217;re setting a new benchmark for educational empowerment in the country,&#8221; Apl.de.Ap said in a statement. </p>



<p>The project is a Khan PH strategy in integrating its cutting-edge education technology into the Philippine school system. It aims to provide one million students across the country access to the Khan Academy platform in their schools by 2026 with its “1 Million Kids Khan Do It!” initiative.  <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

""(Though this) was a collaborative event for Khan Academy Philippines, Apl.de.Ap Foundation, and Accenture. We are open to working with different organizations to help support other schools,"" she added.      Abdon Aguilar, SBNHS principal, said the project would benefit 1,664 students.         Sapang Bato National High School principal Abdon Aguilar (middle) with head teacher Milagros Garcia and master teacher Elmer Cadiang proudly shows the laptops donated by Khan PH, APLFI, and Accenture Philippines. Joann Manabat/Rappler         ""Our students as well as our teachers can now access online platforms for free that they can use in their English, Math, and Science subjects. The free educational upskill programs will help students reach greater opportunities in the future,"" Aguilar told Rappler in Kapampangan.      ""Khan Academy will provide the online platform, Accenture donated the second hand laptops, while APLFI will provide our school with the internet connection,"" he added.      SBNHS consists of 1,202 junior high school and 462 senior high school students in its 30-room campus. It is also known as the ""school with golden opportunities.""      ""Definitely this has a big impact in our lessons especially to our teachers as it becomes easier and more interactive especially since they are 21st century learners. That's why they provided educational technology as a preparation for their future,"" Aguilar said.      An initial batch of 50 preowned Hewlett Packard laptops were given to SBNHS S during a handover ceremony on March 18.       Khan PH was founded by Geraldine Acuna-Sunshine. She is the first Filipino to serve as one of the governing boards at Harvard University. She is a corporate lawyer, community builder, and social impact entrepreneur. Sunshine is also the president of the Philippine Living Heritage Initiative whose mission is to deepen Filipino identity through education across the global Filipino diaspora.      APLFI is a non-profit organization founded by Filipino-American Grammy award-winning musical artist Allan Pineda Lindo, known as Apl.de.Ap of the Black Eyed Peas. APLFI has been supporting SBNHS since 2019, as Sapang Bato is the artist's birthplace. His mom and relatives still reside there.      ""As APLFI's founder, I'm thrilled to bring Khan Academy, a global education pioneer, to the Philippines through our partnership with Khan PH and Accenture. This move not only highlights our commitment to excellence in education for my hometown and beyond but ensures that Filipinos are prepared to meet global standards. Together, we're setting a new benchmark for educational empowerment in the country,"" Apl.de.Ap said in a statement.       The project is a Khan PH strategy in integrating its cutting-edge education technology into the Philippine school system. It aims to provide one million students across the country access to the Khan Academy platform in their schools by 2026 with its ""1 Million Kids Khan Do It!"" initiative.   - Rappler.com         ",Positive

<p>The Philippines has come to terms with the Marcos family’s history. The “best proof” is the election of Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. as president.</p>



<p>This – Marcos’s claim – is my biggest takeaway from the 21-minute&nbsp;<a href=""https://api-esp-ap.piano.io/-c/130/4227/308777/12023618/191978/c486d232bb5d2fbcf615539a32cfccb8/-1/-1?attrs=0&amp;order=0"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;President&nbsp;with the ABC during his visit to Melbourne for the&nbsp;<a href=""https://api-esp-ap.piano.io/-c/130/4227/308777/12023618/191978/93d550fb735f57c2989a45806f8ab8ad/-1/-1?attrs=0&amp;order=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ASEAN-Australia summit</a>&nbsp;in early March.</p>



<p>Here’s the last question in the interview:</p>



<p><em>Q:&nbsp; …other countries in the region, including Australia, want to know that the Philippines and you, as a Marcos, have come to terms with your family’s history.</em></p>



<p><em>A: Of course, we have. We continue to do the work that we feel is our duty and we cannot do that otherwise…I think those issues… there was a time when the issue was Marcos. That is not the case anymore. The best proof of that is my election.</em></p>



<p>The confidence with which Marcos said this and the finality of his conclusion were both striking and disturbing. His statement implies three things:</p>



<ul>
<li>First, that a segment of Filipinos, with little question, has accepted the 14-year dictatorship and its horrific cost to lives and liberty, the top-level corruption and plunder of the country’s coffers;</li>



<li>Second, that many Filipinos have forgotten this dark part of our history and the young ones have no memory of it, not having been taught this in schools;</li>



<li>Third, with that behind us, Marcos can rule without the burden of his family’s history, as if he were given a blank slate upon which to rewrite it and open a new chapter with his presidency. Marcos is saying that his victory is a validation of the public’s acceptance of his family and should put an end to references to their wrongs. This seems to be his story of atonement, a message he brings to the world. </li>
</ul>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-battle-for-memory""><strong>Battle for memory</strong></h5>



<p>Thus, it is vital that there should be no pause in the battle for memory during Marcos’s six-year term. Understandably, there’s this tension between the present and the past as his family’s history hovers over his leadership.&nbsp;Should we judge his presidency in the dark shadow of his late father&#8217;s brutal regime? That, for me, is the inescapable context of his presidency. And the rest is for us to decide – and for history to watch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sure, there are points in his favor. In foreign policy, Marcos is standing up to China, the bully.&nbsp; While he is strengthening our country’s alliance with the US, he is also diversifying the Philippines’ security cooperation with countries like Australia, Japan, Canada, France, UK and the Netherlands. (More on the Philippines and Europe in the later part of this newsletter.)</p>



<p>Another plus point for Marcos is that he is not like his dictator father. He is benign. Those who know him describe the&nbsp;President&nbsp;as someone who exudes “good vibes,” is chill and easygoing. As he told ABC, chuckling: “I have no impulses to authoritarianism whatsoever…I have not felt any tug or temptation to make it a more authoritarian system.”</p>



<p>We welcome this but it doesn’t mean that we downplay the past. Various <a href=""https://api-esp-ap.piano.io/-c/130/4227/308777/12023618/191978/2c36b264e27cbed8c5a1c585c8b84607/-1/-1?attrs=0&amp;order=2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">efforts of schools and civil society groups</a> to document and remember the late dictator’s regime and its downfall should continue.

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-philippines-in-europe-s-eyes""><strong>Philippines in Europe’s eyes</strong></h5>



<p>A few words on Europe’s intensifying interest in the Philippines as Marcos visited Germany, the largest economy in Europe, and the Czech Republic last week.</p>



<p>Europe expanded its gaze to the Philippines starting last year when&nbsp;<a href=""https://api-esp-ap.piano.io/-c/130/4227/308777/12023618/191978/2f9f64c201d593a9b2c9f4de5e4043d4/-1/-1?attrs=0&amp;order=4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ursula von der Leyen</a>&nbsp;visited Manila, the first European Commission president to do so. This signaled Europe’s intent to play a larger role in the Philippines, mainly in maritime security cooperation by “sharing information, conducting threat assessment and building the capacity of the coast guard.”</p>



<p>Soon after Von der Leyen’s meeting with Marcos, the European Union (EU)-Philippine Sub-Committee on Maritime Cooperation, reported to have been created at the request of the Philippines,&nbsp;<a href=""https://api-esp-ap.piano.io/-c/130/4227/308777/12023618/191978/f16eb16d12df3f7ce999beaa963eba60/-1/-1?attrs=0&amp;order=5"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">met for the first time in Brussels</a>&nbsp;in September 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European Commission stated in a&nbsp;<a href=""https://api-esp-ap.piano.io/-c/130/4227/308777/12023618/191978/67e423be5ef569ae75b52241c2cb59f3/-1/-1?attrs=0&amp;order=6"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">readout</a>&nbsp;that the EU and the Philippines agreed to “stand up for the rules-based international order and the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-aggression, as protected by the UN Charter.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The context of all this is China’s escalation of its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea as well as near Taiwan. Moreover, apart from Europe’s emphasis on freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, European defense companies have a role to play as the Philippines modernizes its armed forces and is set to acquire fighter aircraft and warships.</p>



<p>In Berlin, Marcos said in a&nbsp;<a href=""https://api-esp-ap.piano.io/-c/130/4227/308777/12023618/191978/4a8ccb8d054c171ca0635283a4089ad4/-1/-1?attrs=0&amp;order=7"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">press conference</a>&nbsp;with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that there are no details yet of any procurement of defense equipment from Germany but the&nbsp;training of the Philippine armed forces and coast guard will be expanded.&nbsp;It is little known that the Philippines and Germany forged a&nbsp;<a href=""https://api-esp-ap.piano.io/-c/130/4227/308777/12023618/191978/0c12d672271b22d6068fda61a1a6e65c/-1/-1?attrs=0&amp;order=8"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">military training cooperation</a>&nbsp;in 1974.</p>

2623819,in-this-economy-dissecting-resolution-both-houses-charter-change,[In This Economy] Dissecting Resolution of Both Houses 7,"
<p>On Wednesday, March 14, the House of Representatives <a href=""https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2024/03/14/2340401/house-approves-economic-cha-cha"">approved</a> on second reading Resolution of Both Houses 7 (RBH7) aiming to relax some constitutional restrictions on foreign investments. (You can read the full text <a href=""https://hrep-website.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/legisdocs/basic_19/RBH0007.pdf"">here</a>.)</p>



<p>Let me raise three main critiques here.</p>



<p>First, the timing. Just like the law creating the Maharlika Investment Fund, Congress is obviously railroading this resolution, too. House leaders <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/eager-start-charter-change-discussions-lawmakers-file-resolution-both-houses/"">filed</a> RBH7 on February 19, less than a month ago. They plan to approve the resolution on third and final reading next week, before the Lenten break.</p>



<p>Second, the procedure. The House is pushing for amendments to the Constitution using the so-called “<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/explainers/profile-jesuit-constitutionalist-father-joaquin-bernas/"">Bernas formula</a>,” named after the late constitutional expert Father Joaquin Bernas, who proposed that amendments to the Constitution may (theoretically) be treated as if making any other ordinary law.</p>



<p>That is, one chamber proposes a bill amending the Constitution, the chamber deliberates on such a bill, a similar procedure is done in the other chamber, then differences are reconciled in the end.</p>



<p>This Bernas formula contrasts with the three official methods enshrined in the Constitution, namely, a constituent assembly (though the Constitution doesn’t really call it that), a constitutional convention, and people’s initiative.</p>



<p>Constitutional experts already flagged that this Bernas formula will surely be met by a <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/reynato-puno-charter-change-debate-can-congress-amend-constitution-mere-legislation/"">constitutional challenge</a> before the Supreme Court.</p>



<p>Third, it appears that Congress is opening up the 1987 Constitution for the sake of opening up to foreign investments in just three sectors: education, advertising, and public utilities. Is it worth all the trouble? I say no.</p>



<p>Let’s dissect Resolution of Both Houses 7, shall we?</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-public-services"">Public services</h5>



<p>The preamble of RBH7 states that “the nation’s economy policy must be reframed under the demands of this increasingly globalized age, while still protecting the general policy of Filipino-first [sic] that guides the economic provisions of the Constitution.”</p>



<p>Here, already, one should be able to spot a major contradiction. The “increasingly globalized age” that’s mentioned precisely makes the Filipino First policy outdated. Choose a lane!</p>



<p>While they’re at it, they might as well review Section 19 of the 1987 Constitution, which says that: “The State shall develop a self-reliant and independent national economy effectively controlled by Filipinos.” That also sounds like it belongs to a bygone era drastically different from the one we’re now living in.</p>



<p>Another paragraph in RBH7 mentions “there is a need to institutionalize the reforms laid down in the Public Service Act to liberalize industries, promote efficient service delivery, and foster competition as an enduring policy.”</p>



<p>For context, recall that in March 2022, former president Rodrigo Duterte signed a law <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/analysis-is-there-need-fear-amending-public-service-act/"">amending</a> the 1936 Public Service Act. The new law loosened the definition of “public service” and paved the way for 100% foreign ownership in sectors like telecom, shipping, airlines, railways, toll roads, and transport network vehicles.</p>



<p>The problem is that such law is now being challenged in the Supreme Court. Lawmakers say that if the relaxed restrictions are in the Constitution itself, then they won’t be subject to legal challenges, and this could encourage more foreigners to invest in the country.</p>



<p>Sure, but to begin with, investors hardly ever mention constitutional change as a prerequisite for doing business in the country. Most cite excessive red tape, corruption, and inadequate infrastructure as turn-offs. A previous version of the <a href=""https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2011/05may/Phil-Dev-Plan-2011-2016-Chapter-7-BSA.pdf"">Philippine Development Plan</a> stated that “Investors have pointed to corruption as the most problematic factor for doing business.”</p>



<p>In addition, won’t constitutional reform open a can of worms that could potentially lead to even more uncertainty and disruption if, say, lawmakers tinker with political provisions like term limits?</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-education"">Education</h5>



<p>RBH7 also says that “our children deserve to have access to the best educational institutions, both Filipino and foreign, to ensure that they receive the best training to become globally competitive citizens in the modern world.”</p>



<p>Here we need to be realistic. If this pushes through, just how many educational institutions can we expect to come in and do business here in the Philippines? Can these new schools quench our thirst for foreign capital? Hardly.</p>



<p>If you look at the proposed constitutional provision regarding education, RBH7 wants to restrict foreign investments to educational institutions other than basic education institutions. That is, foreigners can fully own only higher educational institutions and presumably technical-vocational schools. But in fact, if there’s one sector in education that needs the most “saving,” that would be <em>basic</em> education, which is in <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/in-this-economy-spare-thought-philippines-learning-poverty-rate/"">deep crisis</a> now.</p>



<p>Also, lawmakers seem to be overlooking the fact that education has already been revolutionized by online learning. For instance, top-notch universities abroad (including Ivy League schools) already provide online courses on YouTube and other platforms.</p>



<p>Sure, some of the world’s best universities have branches in many parts of the world. But even the most successful case studies don’t turn out to be sustainable.</p>



<p>For example, the liberal arts program developed by Yale University together with the National University of Singapore had just <a href=""https://sites.duke.edu/thelilypad/2024/02/04/lessons-learned-from-the-closure-of-yale-nus-the-importance-of-communication-and-curricular-adaptability/"">recently ended</a>, apparently because of clashes in objectives and culture.</p>



<p>Patricia Licuanan, former chair of the Commission on Higher Education, also <a href=""https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/898030/ex-ched-chair-licuanan-opposes-foreign-ownership-of-educational-institutions-via-cha-cha/story/"">said</a> in a recent Senate hearing that “foreign universities, while possibly attracted by our large young population, will soon discover after careful market studies that branch campuses in the Philippines will not be sustainable.”</p>



<p>In general, the many problems beleaguering education in the country can’t be fixed by simply bringing in foreigners to set up their own schools.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-advertising"">Advertising</h5>



<p>Next, RBH7 says that “the advertising industry currently already has foreign players and liberalizing the same is a logical and sound policy to attract foreign direct investment in that industry.”</p>



<p>This is perhaps the flimsiest of all. First, even lawmakers admit that foreigners are already in the sector. Second, similar to education, will there be a tsunami of advertising firms that will come in and fill the gap of foreign investments in the Philippines? It’s naive to think so.</p>



<p>Third and most importantly, regulating advertising this way seems anachronistic. Latest data show that <a href=""https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/advertising/philippines#ad-spending"">more than half</a> of ad spending in the Philippines is for online ads. And as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUjFksKH53k"">mentioned</a> by an advertising veteran in a House hearing, “Content creation can be done anywhere around the world without bringing in people into the Philippines.”</p>



<p>Advertising is limited to Filipinos in the Constitution presumably to make sure that ads contain content that promotes Filipino identity, culture, and values. But what does that even mean in an era when there are literally no barriers to seeing content made from other countries?</p>



<p>If this is the spirit of the Constitution, the better way to go is to bolster regulations in advertising. But even that sounds contrary to the “demands of this increasingly globalized age,” and also the promotion of free thinking among our people.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-unless-otherwise-provided-by-law"">‘Unless otherwise provided by law’</h5>



<p>Looking now at the meat of lawmakers’ proposed constitutional amendments, they really just want to insert the phrase “unless otherwise provided by law” into some provisions of the 1987 Constitution, namely:</p>



<ol type=""1"">
<li>The 40% foreign ownership cap in public utilities</li>



<li>Participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any public utility limited to their share in capital</li>



<li>Limitation to Filipino citizens of executive and managing officers of corporations or associations in public utility enterprises</li>



<li>Filipino citizens’ control and administration of educational institutions;</li>



<li>The 30% foreign ownership cap in advertising</li>



<li>Participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any advertising entity limited to their share in capital</li>



<li>Limitation to Filipino citizens of executive and managing officers of corporations or associations in advertising entities</li>
</ol>



<p>Taken together, it’s quite a stretch of the imagination to say that opening up the three sectors will open the floodgates to investments in the country. That’s bordering on delusional.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-voting-jointly-or-separately"">Voting jointly or separately?</h5>



<p>There’s one more troubling aspect to RBH7. Lawmakers want to amend the Constitution “upon a vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all its Members.”</p>



<p>Until now we don’t know if that will be interpreted as a 3/4 vote of the entire Congress (House plus Senate) or if they’ll be voting separately.</p>



<p>The prospect of joint voting is the main sticking point as far as the Senate is concerned. Simply put, it will render them useless. That is why there are, as of now, slim chances that the Senate will pass its own Resolution of Both Houses.</p>



<p>The House leadership gave assurances that they will ensure “voting separately.” But who knows what will happen in the coming months? What if they bully the Senate by showing that they approved their own resolution with overwhelming numbers? What if senators cave in to the pressure?</p>



<p>Most worryingly, what if Congress changes its mind and decides to tinker as well with term limits and other <em>political</em> provisions of the Constitution?</p>

","<p>It’s quite a stretch of the imagination to say that opening up the three sectors – education, advertising, and public utilities – will open the floodgates to investments in the country. That’s bordering on delusional.</p>
",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/in-this-economy-dissecting-resolution-both-houses-charter-change/,2024-03-18T11:04:25,2024-03-18T11:04:29,"[16490, 758, 755]",[In This Economy] Dissecting Resolution of Both Houses 7,"  On Wednesday, March 14, the House of Representatives  approved  on second reading Resolution of Both Houses 7 (RBH7) aiming to relax some constitutional restrictions on foreign investments. (You can read the full text  here .)      Let me raise three main critiques here.      First, the timing. Just like the law creating the Maharlika Investment Fund, Congress is obviously railroading this resolution, too. House leaders  filed  RBH7 on February 19, less than a month ago. They plan to approve the resolution on third and final reading next week, before the Lenten break.      Second, the procedure. The House is pushing for amendments to the Constitution using the so-called "" Bernas formula ,"" named after the late constitutional expert Father Joaquin Bernas, who proposed that amendments to the Constitution may (theoretically) be treated as if making any other ordinary law.      That is, one chamber proposes a bill amending the Constitution, the chamber deliberates on such a bill, a similar procedure is done in the other chamber, then differences are reconciled in the end.      This Bernas formula contrasts with the three official methods enshrined in the Constitution, namely, a constituent assembly (though the Constitution doesn't really call it that), a constitutional convention, and people's initiative.      Constitutional experts already flagged that this Bernas formula will surely be met by a  constitutional challenge  before the Supreme Court.      Third, it appears that Congress is opening up the 1987 Constitution for the sake of opening up to foreign investments in just three sectors: education, advertising, and public utilities. Is it worth all the trouble? I say no.      Let's dissect Resolution of Both Houses 7, shall we?      Public services      The preamble of RBH7 states that ""the nation's economy policy must be reframed under the demands of this increasingly globalized age, while still protecting the general policy of Filipino-first [sic] that guides the economic provisions of the Constitution.""      Here, already, one should be able to spot a major contradiction. The ""increasingly globalized age"" that's mentioned precisely makes the Filipino First policy outdated. Choose a lane!      While they're at it, they might as well review Section 19 of the 1987 Constitution, which says that: ""The State shall develop a self-reliant and independent national economy effectively controlled by Filipinos."" That also sounds like it belongs to a bygone era drastically different from the one we're now living in.      Another paragraph in RBH7 mentions ""there is a need to institutionalize the reforms laid down in the Public Service Act to liberalize industries, promote efficient service delivery, and foster competition as an enduring policy.""      For context, recall that in March 2022, former president Rodrigo Duterte signed a law  amending  the 1936 Public Service Act. The new law loosened the definition of ""public service"" and paved the way for 100% foreign ownership in sectors like telecom, shipping, airlines, railways, toll roads, and transport network vehicles.      The problem is that such law is now being challenged in the Supreme Court. Lawmakers say that if the relaxed restrictions are in the Constitution itself, then they won't be subject to legal challenges, and this could encourage more foreigners to invest in the country.      Sure, but to begin with, investors hardly ever mention constitutional change as a prerequisite for doing business in the country. Most cite excessive red tape, corruption, and inadequate infrastructure as turn-offs. A previous version of the  Philippine Development Plan  stated that ""Investors have pointed to corruption as the most problematic factor for doing business.""      In addition, won't constitutional reform open a can of worms that could potentially lead to even more uncertainty and disruption if, say, lawmakers tinker with political provisions like term limits?      Education      RBH7 also says that ""our children deserve to have access to the best educational institutions, both Filipino and foreign, to ensure that they receive the best training to become globally competitive citizens in the modern world.""      Here we need to be realistic. If this pushes through, just how many educational institutions can we expect to come in and do business here in the Philippines? Can these new schools quench our thirst for foreign capital? Hardly.      If you look at the proposed constitutional provision regarding education, RBH7 wants to restrict foreign investments to educational institutions other than basic education institutions. That is, foreigners can fully own only higher educational institutions and presumably technical-vocational schools. But in fact, if there's one sector in education that needs the most ""saving,"" that would be  basic  education, which is in  deep crisis  now.      Also, lawmakers seem to be overlooking the fact that education has already been revolutionized by online learning. For instance, top-notch universities abroad (including Ivy League schools) already provide online courses on YouTube and other platforms.      Sure, some of the world's best universities have branches in many parts of the world. But even the most successful case studies don't turn out to be sustainable.      For example, the liberal arts program developed by Yale University together with the National University of Singapore had just  recently ended , apparently because of clashes in objectives and culture.      Patricia Licuanan, former chair of the Commission on Higher Education, also  said  in a recent Senate hearing that ""foreign universities, while possibly attracted by our large young population, will soon discover after careful market studies that branch campuses in the Philippines will not be sustainable.""      In general, the many problems beleaguering education in the country can't be fixed by simply bringing in foreigners to set up their own schools.      Advertising      Next, RBH7 says that ""the advertising industry currently already has foreign players and liberalizing the same is a logical and sound policy to attract foreign direct investment in that industry.""      This is perhaps the flimsiest of all. First, even lawmakers admit that foreigners are already in the sector. Second, similar to education, will there be a tsunami of advertising firms that will come in and fill the gap of foreign investments in the Philippines? It's naive to think so.      Third and most importantly, regulating advertising this way seems anachronistic. Latest data show that  more than half  of ad spending in the Philippines is for online ads. And as  mentioned  by an advertising veteran in a House hearing, ""Content creation can be done anywhere around the world without bringing in people into the Philippines.""      Advertising is limited to Filipinos in the Constitution presumably to make sure that ads contain content that promotes Filipino identity, culture, and values. But what does that even mean in an era when there are literally no barriers to seeing content made from other countries?      If this is the spirit of the Constitution, the better way to go is to bolster regulations in advertising. But even that sounds contrary to the ""demands of this increasingly globalized age,"" and also the promotion of free thinking among our people.      'Unless otherwise provided by law'      Looking now at the meat of lawmakers' proposed constitutional amendments, they really just want to insert the phrase ""unless otherwise provided by law"" into some provisions of the 1987 Constitution, namely:        The 40% foreign ownership cap in public utilities      Participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any public utility limited to their share in capital      Limitation to Filipino citizens of executive and managing officers of corporations or associations in public utility enterprises      Filipino citizens' control and administration of educational institutions;      The 30% foreign ownership cap in advertising      Participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any advertising entity limited to their share in capital      Limitation to Filipino citizens of executive and managing officers of corporations or associations in advertising entities        Taken together, it's quite a stretch of the imagination to say that opening up the three sectors will open the floodgates to investments in the country. That's bordering on delusional.      Voting jointly or separately?      There's one more troubling aspect to RBH7. Lawmakers want to amend the Constitution ""upon a vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all its Members.""      Until now we don't know if that will be interpreted as a 3/4 vote of the entire Congress (House plus Senate) or if they'll be voting separately.      The prospect of joint voting is the main sticking point as far as the Senate is concerned. Simply put, it will render them useless. That is why there are, as of now, slim chances that the Senate will pass its own Resolution of Both Houses.      The House leadership gave assurances that they will ensure ""voting separately."" But who knows what will happen in the coming months? What if they bully the Senate by showing that they approved their own resolution with overwhelming numbers? What if senators cave in to the pressure?      Most worryingly, what if Congress changes its mind and decides to tinker as well with term limits and other  political  provisions of the Constitution?      This is why some opposition leaders are changing tack.  Said  Albay 1 st  District Representative Edcel Lagman, ""There's no good strategy against an overwhelming majority because, at the end of the day, it's a numbers game.

<p>MANILA, Philippines – According to Tor Sagud, there are still far too many misconceptions about life in the Cordilleras – the Northern Luzon region composed of provinces Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Mountain Province.</p>



<p>“Today, Igorots are still perceived as primitive – non-humans or cannibals – and that they only wear breechcloths,” the 33-year-old Baguio local shared, referring to one of the region’s indigenous peoples. “Another misconception is that Igorots are the same as Aetas, which is another ethnic group. Some also believe Cordillerans don’t have their own functioning society.”</p>



<p>These misconceptions, among many others, were what his book <em>Igorotak: An Illustrated Guide </em>sought to debunk when it was first published in 2019. The book, filled with colorful drawings on the basics of Cordillera culture,<em> </em>has since been celebrated as a creative means of introducing local heritage, and has spawned spin-offs on Igorot tools, Igorot mythological creatures, and more.&nbsp;</p>

A peek inside &#8216;Igorotak&#8217;s&#8217; colorful pages. Tor Sagud</figcaption></figure>



<p>Because of his efforts, Sagud was announced on March 12 by Junior Chamber International Philippines as one of the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/about/jc-punongbayan-the-outstanding-young-men-award-2023/"">10 recipients of The Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) Awards</a> for 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rappler interviewed Sagud on his win, his origins as an artist, and his struggles as a creative worker in the Philippines. Some answers have been edited for brevity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Rappler: How did you first get into visual art? What were your earliest memories of drawing?</em></strong></p>



<p>Sagud: I&#8217;m a self-taught artist. I started drawing at the age of six. My family and I loved to watch cartoons at home, and even then, I’d already wondered if Filipinos were also making these kinds of shows. I started copying what I’d seen on TV, and also copied illustrations from textbooks and <em>teks</em> (game cards).</p>



<p>When I was 15, I realized copying images from printed materials was no longer enough. I wanted to make my own stories with illustrations. I chose comics since I figured it was the most effective format for delivering my stories, and I could just use cheap materials from generic bookstores.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Rappler: In the years leading up to your celebrated book, Igorotak, </em></strong><a href=""https://pilipinaspopcorn.com/cordilleran-visionary-artist-tor-sagud-igorotak-educational-book/""><strong><em>you struggled as a comic book artist:</em></strong></a><strong><em> Could you tell us more about these earlier years?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Sagud: The comics industry seemed so out of reach since I saw that professional comics companies required expensive digital equipment, exclusive editors and officers, funders, and distributors. I was an eccentric guy by nature and had no idea how to pursue all these, so I was forced to surrender my dreams [of getting into the mainstream].&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Rappler: You&#8217;re also co-chair of Gripo Comics, a local comic book artists’ group based in Baguio. How is Gripo Comics and its artists doing so far?</em></strong></p>



<p>Sagud: When I was 22, I joined Gripo Comics, a local band of comic artists. At the same time, I was doing a scholarship program at the Cordillera School of Digital Arts. Balancing these things while working to survive was too hard. At the time I was also working at the Central Luzon School of Digital Arts (CLSDA) as an animation department head instructor in Cabanatuan City.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I returned to Baguio in 2016 and became one of the founders of the Pasa-Kalye Group of Artists, which played a major role in getting Baguio recognized as a UNESCO Creative City in 2018. At the same time, I was also taking teaching jobs from different schools. Basically, in order to continue to make comics, I needed to work non-stop and also teach artists to appreciate their own culture.</p>



<p>Right now, Gripo is on hiatus. I’m now focused on growing my own company, Studio Sagud, which serves as a creative outsourcing company that also does cultural research and creates art products and animated films.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rappler: You came out with Igorotak – an educational illustrated book about Cordillera culture – in 2019. What inspired you to create Igorotak?</em></strong></p>



<p>Sagud: <em>Igorotak</em> was inspired by several instances in my life. For one, when I was teaching animation in CLSDA, one of my students asked me about Whang-od. I was dumbfounded when I realized I couldn’t answer her question, despite me originating from the same region as the <em>mambabatok</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another instance was when I was already in Baguio trying out traditional painting. I made a series of paintings which showcased and differentiated the different ethnic groups in our region, but these paintings were ignored by buyers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also noticed that some of my young art students were ignorant of their own history and culture. Most of them were even vocal about using foreign elements in their concepts rather than local. Additionally, I&#8217;ve observed that a lot of children today don’t love reading anymore, especially if the books are text-heavy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All these inspired me to come up with <em>Igorotak.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Rappler: Were there any challenges in the publication of this book? If so, what were they?</em></strong></p>



<p>Sagud: The book was a new challenge for me since I had to shift from visual artist to writer. I gathered information from past discussions with people, journals, and whatever other references I could use. When I finished the manuscript, I tried pitching for sponsorships from different government bodies and private establishments, and those days were like scenes from a movie – I’d be flat-out rejected or would not receive any response from them. I didn&#8217;t know who to approach. Fortunately, a friend of a friend – who chooses to remain anonymous – soon agreed to provide me with the kickstart budget.</p>



<p><strong><em>Rappler: How has the reception been, especially now that it’s 2024?</em></strong></p>



<p>Sagud: The reception to the book was more than what I&#8217;d expected. It garnered the attention of many cultural experts, educators, etc., and people saw the potential of employing the arts in educational materials. Experts also helped me by providing more precise information, which led to the second edition of <em>Igorotak</em>. Even foreigners sent me messages of appreciation.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve hit the mark in that the book has paved the way for more local creative people to be employed. I&#8217;ve even released three more books since. In my honest opinion, however, a great number of Filipinos are still hesitant to appreciate their own culture. Maybe in a few more years, they would finally be more appreciative of their local culture and start buying their own local products.</p>



<p><strong><em>Rappler: You just won the TOYM for heritage promotion. How does it feel to have gotten this distinction?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Sagud: I am deeply honored and very appreciative of the opportunity given to me. I would also like to clarify that this achievement is actually a collective effort, since many people have already supported my movement in the years since I launched the first book. I merely represent these good people.</p>



<p>We at Studio Sagud are adding more titles to the <em>Igorotak</em> book series, like the <em>Igorot Creatures Collection, Volume 2-3</em> and <em>Igorot Equipment Collection, Volume 2</em>. We also continue to look for sponsors since research and book designing demands a lot of people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We&#8217;re also working on<em> Kadangyan Komiks</em>, a pulp comics title that features alternate literature, with interesting stories and hero characters. We&#8217;re also creating the very first seasonal anime film that features Cordillera culture.&nbsp;</p>

At the time I was also working at the Central Luzon School of Digital Arts (CLSDA) as an animation department head instructor in Cabanatuan City.       I returned to Baguio in 2016 and became one of the founders of the Pasa-Kalye Group of Artists, which played a major role in getting Baguio recognized as a UNESCO Creative City in 2018. At the same time, I was also taking teaching jobs from different schools. Basically, in order to continue to make comics, I needed to work non-stop and also teach artists to appreciate their own culture.      Right now, Gripo is on hiatus. I'm now focused on growing my own company, Studio Sagud, which serves as a creative outsourcing company that also does cultural research and creates art products and animated films.        FILIPINAS. Bookmarks featuring local women of varying ethnic groups. Tor Sagud               FILIPINOS. Bookmarks featuring local men of varying ethnic groups. Tor Sagud         Rappler: You came out with Igorotak - an educational illustrated book about Cordillera culture - in 2019. What inspired you to create Igorotak?        Sagud:  Igorotak  was inspired by several instances in my life. For one, when I was teaching animation in CLSDA, one of my students asked me about Whang-od. I was dumbfounded when I realized I couldn't answer her question, despite me originating from the same region as the  mambabatok .       Another instance was when I was already in Baguio trying out traditional painting. I made a series of paintings which showcased and differentiated the different ethnic groups in our region, but these paintings were ignored by buyers.       I also noticed that some of my young art students were ignorant of their own history and culture. Most of them were even vocal about using foreign elements in their concepts rather than local. Additionally, I've observed that a lot of children today don't love reading anymore, especially if the books are text-heavy.       All these inspired me to come up with  Igorotak.          Rappler: Were there any challenges in the publication of this book? If so, what were they?        Sagud: The book was a new challenge for me since I had to shift from visual artist to writer. I gathered information from past discussions with people, journals, and whatever other references I could use. When I finished the manuscript, I tried pitching for sponsorships from different government bodies and private establishments, and those days were like scenes from a movie - I'd be flat-out rejected or would not receive any response from them. I didn't know who to approach. Fortunately, a friend of a friend - who chooses to remain anonymous - soon agreed to provide me with the kickstart budget.        Rappler: How has the reception been, especially now that it's 2024?        Sagud: The reception to the book was more than what I'd expected. It garnered the attention of many cultural experts, educators, etc., and people saw the potential of employing the arts in educational materials. Experts also helped me by providing more precise information, which led to the second edition of  Igorotak . Even foreigners sent me messages of appreciation.      We've hit the mark in that the book has paved the way for more local creative people to be employed. I've even released three more books since. In my honest opinion, however, a great number of Filipinos are still hesitant to appreciate their own culture. Maybe in a few more years, they would finally be more appreciative of their local culture and start buying their own local products.        Rappler: You just won the TOYM for heritage promotion. How does it feel to have gotten this distinction?         Sagud: I am deeply honored and very appreciative of the opportunity given to me. I would also like to clarify that this achievement is actually a collective effort, since many people have already supported my movement in the years since I launched the first book. I merely represent these good people.      We at Studio Sagud are adding more titles to the  Igorotak  book series, like the  Igorot Creatures Collection, Volume 2-3  and  Igorot Equipment Collection, Volume 2 . We also continue to look for sponsors since research and book designing demands a lot of people.         SPIN-OFFS. The different titles under the ‘Igorotak' book series. Sherry Mae Saxton       We're also working on  Kadangyan Komiks , a pulp comics title that features alternate literature, with interesting stories and hero characters. We're also creating the very first seasonal anime film that features Cordillera culture.       Studio Sagud also continues to provide training for aspiring artists, especially animators, helping them to upskill to actual industry standards. We also provide avenues for artists to land jobs with our partner companies. We also coordinate with schools in order to teach more young artists.      Finally, I'm trying to find a decent suit to wear at the TOYM awarding.  - Rappler.com   ",Neutral

<p class=""has-drop-cap"">The cart before the horse, one of our editors called it – Captain’s Peak Resort, that is.</p>



<p>The whole world saw how an entire government went haywire over a small resort situated at the bottom of three Chocolate Hills in Carmen town, Bohol. Many concerned citizens have pointed out how the resort had “defaced” the hills as slides and cottages were built on the protected mound’s foot.</p>

<p>Officials at both the municipal and provincial levels were the most shocked, however, when the DENR said that a temporary closure order (TCO) was issued way back in September 2023. They only learned about the order after DENR’s announcement on Wednesday, March 13.</p>



<p>Almost like a chorus to a long-running ballad, the officials said, “We didn’t know about it.”</p>



<p>While it may seem like they’re off the hook for being blindsided by the DENR, some locals and Captain’s Peak Resort administrator Julieta Sablas told Rappler that the provincial government still held a swimming competition between February 16 and 18 even though they led a probe on it as early as August 2023.</p>



<p>So what’s the truth? Did the provincial government just forget about the controversy or did it just give in and say “to heck with it” for the sports event?</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-the-resort-in-question""><strong>The resort in question&nbsp;</strong></h5>



<p>Let’s establish the basic facts. For one, the resort got a business permit in 2019. They didn’t have an ECC back then and at present…yet Sagbayan Mayor Restituto Suarez III <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/sagbayan-bohol-revokes-chocolate-hills-resort-business-permit/"">still signed on the permit’s renewal</a>.</p>



<p>The mayor’s executive secretary, Felito Pon, told Rappler that it happened because there was a “regular presumption” that the concerned government agencies had already reviewed all the attachments to the renewal.</p>



<p>This may explain the “cart without the horse” – a resort built without a completely valid permit that justifies its construction. But it won’t explain why the town’s mayor just assumed the necessary papers were okay without first checking if everything was in order. Never assume, is the rule, right?</p>

<p>Sablas told Rappler on Thursday, March 14, that they began development in 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After reports of the resort’s access road allegedly defaced two Chocolate hills and slides were built on the hills surfaced in August 2023, the province began its investigation into the resort.</p>



<p>Rappler visited the site in Sagbayan town and found an access road that seemingly cuts through the foot of two hills. At the resort’s swimming pool, there are two slides set up at least seven feet at the foot of another set of hills.</p>

<p>“I wrote a letter to the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO)&#8230;They provided us with the same story from (officials) of Sagbayan – that they have the title, the Protected Areas Management Board (PAMB) resolution and the approval of DENR,” Bohol Governor Erico Aristotle Aumentado told Rappler on Friday, March 15.</p>



<p>The governor added that he instructed the committee on natural resources and environmental protection, led by Bohol Provincial Board Member Jamie Villamor, to investigate further.</p>



<p>Villamor told Rappler on Friday afternoon that they asked for findings from the investigation but never received any copy.</p>



<p>“After follow-ups through phone calls, the answers were consistent that (Captain’s Peak) was still in the process of complying, still revising, and we were just waiting until what happened in the viral video,” Villamor said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>The province knew</strong></h5>



<p>Metodio Maraguinot Jr., head of the provincial government’s education development center, revealed on Friday that the province became aware that the provincial swim meet&nbsp;was going to be held at the controversial resort through concerned parents in late 2023.</p>



<p>“The provincial meet that was done at Captain’s Peak was actually organized by the local division office, which is the division of Bohol Department of Education (DepEd). The only role that the provincial government extended is specifically for the assistance under the Special Education Fund,” Maraguinot said.</p>



<p>The sports event is one of the DepEd’s highlights leading up to the Central Visayas Regional Athletic Association (CVIRAA) meet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maraguinot clarified that the provincial government gave P2 million for the event but intended the fund to be used for the venue that was supposed to be in Carmen town. He added that the town government was the recipient of the P2 million.</p>



<p>But why did the venue change from Carmen town to Sagbayan town?</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Lack of facilities</strong></h5>



<p>Rappler visited the office of Carmen Mayor Conchita “Che” Toribio Delos Reyes to ask why they moved the event that was supposed to be staged in the town to Sagbayan – around 17 kilometers away from each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mayor was not around but the municipal administrator, lawyer Eliezer Cagol Jr., told Rappler on Friday afternoon that they did not have any facilities for the swimming competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lawyer refused to give any further information, deferring to the mayor who will release a statement on the issue at a later date.</p>



<p>Pon told reporters on Thursday that the conveners of the provincial meet requested Sagbayan to allow them to move their venue to Captain’s Peak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For humanitarian consideration, <em>meron naman tayong ganyan so pinahintulutan natin ‘yon</em> (we had something like that so we allowed it),” the Sagbayan mayor’s executive secretary said.</p>



<p>As of Thursday, the mayor’s face and the town’s seal could still be seen on the poster set up beside the resort’s pool.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>In the end</strong></h5>



<p>Going back, DepEd still had the discretion to decide where the event would take place, but did it know about the controversy? Apparently.</p>



<p>Maraguinot told Rappler that the DepEd Bohol Division Office pushed through with the swimming competition at the viral resort despite efforts to relay the parents’ concerns and a proposal to hold the event instead at the Carlos P. Garcia Sports Complex in Tagbilaran City.</p>



<p>“In fairness to DepEd, they did have a consultation with us, we had a dialogue about it, but still their decision was to hold the swimming competition at the Captain’s Peak because apparently they have already planned, already organized, already made the necessary arrangements,” Maraguinot said.</p>



<p>Rappler reached out to DepEd Bohol Schools Division Superintendent Casiana Caberte for comment on the issue but we have yet to receive a reply.</p>



<p>With all the puzzle pieces in place, we now know that DepEd pushed through with the sports event at the controversial resort, with the cooperation of the local governments of Sagbayan and Carmen, despite the concerns raised by the province and parents.</p>



<p>In the end, the resort <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/chocolate-hills-resort-shuts-down-march-14-2024/"">closed its doors</a> on Thursday, not knowing when it would be able to operate again. At least 16 employees, mostly mothers supporting their children, lost their jobs overnight, and their families will have to live with that. A cart without a horse that has resulted in a painful crash. </p>



<p>As the Sagbayan mayor’s executive secretary put it, “<em>Nangyari na kasi, hindi na natin mababago.</em>” (It has already happened and we can&#8217;t change it.) <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

The province knew       Metodio Maraguinot Jr., head of the provincial government's education development center, revealed on Friday that the province became aware that the provincial swim meet was going to be held at the controversial resort through concerned parents in late 2023.      ""The provincial meet that was done at Captain's Peak was actually organized by the local division office, which is the division of Bohol Department of Education (DepEd). The only role that the provincial government extended is specifically for the assistance under the Special Education Fund,"" Maraguinot said.      The sports event is one of the DepEd's highlights leading up to the Central Visayas Regional Athletic Association (CVIRAA) meet.       Maraguinot clarified that the provincial government gave P2 million for the event but intended the fund to be used for the venue that was supposed to be in Carmen town. He added that the town government was the recipient of the P2 million.      But why did the venue change from Carmen town to Sagbayan town?       Lack of facilities       Rappler visited the office of Carmen Mayor Conchita ""Che"" Toribio Delos Reyes to ask why they moved the event that was supposed to be staged in the town to Sagbayan - around 17 kilometers away from each other.       The mayor was not around but the municipal administrator, lawyer Eliezer Cagol Jr., told Rappler on Friday afternoon that they did not have any facilities for the swimming competition.       The lawyer refused to give any further information, deferring to the mayor who will release a statement on the issue at a later date.      Pon told reporters on Thursday that the conveners of the provincial meet requested Sagbayan to allow them to move their venue to Captain's Peak.       ""For humanitarian consideration,  meron naman tayong ganyan so pinahintulutan natin 'yon  (we had something like that so we allowed it),"" the Sagbayan mayor's executive secretary said.      As of Thursday, the mayor's face and the town's seal could still be seen on the poster set up beside the resort's pool.       In the end       Going back, DepEd still had the discretion to decide where the event would take place, but did it know about the controversy? Apparently.      Maraguinot told Rappler that the DepEd Bohol Division Office pushed through with the swimming competition at the viral resort despite efforts to relay the parents' concerns and a proposal to hold the event instead at the Carlos P. Garcia Sports Complex in Tagbilaran City.      ""In fairness to DepEd, they did have a consultation with us, we had a dialogue about it, but still their decision was to hold the swimming competition at the Captain's Peak because apparently they have already planned, already organized, already made the necessary arrangements,"" Maraguinot said.      Rappler reached out to DepEd Bohol Schools Division Superintendent Casiana Caberte for comment on the issue but we have yet to receive a reply.      With all the puzzle pieces in place, we now know that DepEd pushed through with the sports event at the controversial resort, with the cooperation of the local governments of Sagbayan and Carmen, despite the concerns raised by the province and parents.      In the end, the resort  closed its doors  on Thursday, not knowing when it would be able to operate again. At least 16 employees, mostly mothers supporting their children, lost their jobs overnight, and their families will have to live with that. A cart without a horse that has resulted in a painful crash.       As the Sagbayan mayor's executive secretary put it, "" Nangyari na kasi, hindi na natin mababago.

<p>(We weren&#8217;t allowed [to enroll] even if we wore a bun&#8230;. I thought at that time, I wanted to finally enroll because my parents know that I can study without having my hair cut.) </p>



<p>She added that she cut her hair as a &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; for her fellow trans students as she felt that they lost their voice in EARIST. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-why-did-this-happen"">Why did this happen?</h5>



<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/100057652711305/posts/504778624662075/"">2021 EARIST student handbook&#8217;s</a> code of conduct and discipline, male students should observe a barber’s haircut. Meanwhile, the only restriction for female students, was not being allowed to sport colorful highlights.</p>



<p>The handbook also states that students have the right to “freely express one’s gender preference to follow the norms of the Institution without due prejudice to any provisions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bahaghari-EARIST president Red Riotoc and women’s representative JP Brillantes told Rappler that the issue on the need for trans women to cut their hair for enrollment has been constantly raised with the school administration.</p>



<p>“<em>Paulit-ulit na kami nagpabalik-balik sa different offices, paulit-ulit kami nagpapasa ng different papers.

<p>Representatives from the LGBTQ+ community, including Bahaghari-EARIST, also had a dialogue with EARIST president Rogelio Mamaradlo on <a href=""https://twitter.com/arrisamsico/status/1711428057901433273"">October 9, 2023</a> with a demand letter drafted by the organization, with the help of Rainbow Rights Philippines. </p>



<p>The meeting led to a “verbal agreement” allowing transgender women to enroll for the first semester of school year 2023-2024 without any conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the second semester though the issue once again erupted this month after Bahaghari-EARIST received over 40 complaints from transgender students in the college of business and public administration, claiming that they were not allowed to enroll on March 11. </p>



<p>This led the organization to draft a resolution urging the school administration to allow students to wear school uniform and grow their hair according to their gender identity and expression.</p>

<p>Following the submission of the resolution to school administration officials, a meeting was held with LGBTQ+ representatives, EARIST’s student affairs and services office, and college deans on Tuesday, March 12. </p>



<p>“<em>‘Yung iba’t ibang department, may iba’t ibang rules po sa LGBTQ+ [students]. Sa college po namin, college of business and public administration, ang required po is shoulder length and nakatali [ang buhok],” </em>Riotoc said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Different departments had different rules for the LGBTQ+ students. In our college, the college of business and public administration, the requirement is that the hair should be shoulder length and tied.)</p>



<p>Following the meeting, the college of business and public administration agreed to allow third and fourth year transgender students to keep their long hair. However, first and second year students had to cut their hair to shoulder length. </p>



<p>Students in the colleges of education, criminology, tourism, have to adhere to the male haircut policies. Other students could keep their long hair, but have to adhere to other rules of their college such as tying it into a bun.  </p>



<p>On Friday, Marmadlo said Tuesday&#8217;s meeting&nbsp;ended &#8220;with the agreement that the parties shall convene again to discuss the possibility of a new set of implementing rules and regulations concerning enrollment.&#8221;</p>

2617154,british-school-manila-students-building-better-philippines-grassroots-collaborations,British School Manila students are building a better PH with grassroots collaborations,"
<p>Many realities exist in the Philippines, from those of indigenous communities to PWD folks to the regular British School Manila (BSM) student. Although their stories differ, they share one&nbsp; country as a home – and that’s why genuine impact starts with each sector understanding each other for collective action.</p>



<p>This lesson stands out in BSM’s curriculum, particularly because the students go out and progressively immerse themselves in marginalized communities each year. Last January, the school held their second annual Make a Difference (MAD) Week, an on-ground trip where BSM students engage with different social sectors to holistically understand their stories and build lasting relationships.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Opening young eyes to intersectionality</strong></h5>



<p>The program is designed to progress for four years, so students can find the causes they resonate with and work with their chosen community long-term.</p>



<p>“We kind of flipped the model in school,” said Michael Guinness, BSM’s senior Service and Sustainability curriculum coordinator. “I think too often we make assumptions about communities and about people who are underprivileged, or even an ecosystem that&#8217;s underprivileged, and we don&#8217;t give them the space to tell us what&#8217;s going on.”</p>



<p>Instead of a one-and-done activity, the school focused on facilitating more authentic and collaborative experiences for both students and partner communities. This way, the students get a broader picture, seeing how larger factors like the environment or economy are entangled with these sectors’ narratives.</p>



<p>“It builds that long-term ability to truly understand these communities that we&#8217;re working with, and make sure that we&#8217;re working alongside them, not ‘to’ them or ‘at’ them.

<p>These stories struck a chord with Dalisaï and her personal experiences as a French-Filipino individual. “They have, I guess, an identity loss. I&#8217;ve faced, of course to a much lesser extent, the feeling sometimes that I do not fit certain prospects of being a French or Filipino individual.

<p>Another Year 10 student, Maximillian Holden, had his first encounter with the farming ecosystem during his Costales Nature Reserve visit. The experience allowed him to widen his viewpoint beyond just planting crops.</p>

<p>This has always been the program’s DNA, which was borne of an extensive collaboration between BSM and social enterprise group MAD Travel. “The current education system tends to take [topics] apart and keep them separate, but we all know that our environment is connected to the economy. It&#8217;s integrated,” said Rafael Dionisio, a co-founder of MAD Travel.</p>



<p>“We can&#8217;t separate them from one another, and so dissolving those separations is important. So we&#8217;re super happy about [the BSM collaboration]. They&#8217;re setting an example for other schools that, hey, it can be done.”</p>

Although their stories differ, they share one  country as a home - and that's why genuine impact starts with each sector understanding each other for collective action.      This lesson stands out in BSM's curriculum, particularly because the students go out and progressively immerse themselves in marginalized communities each year. Last January, the school held their second annual Make a Difference (MAD) Week, an on-ground trip where BSM students engage with different social sectors to holistically understand their stories and build lasting relationships.       Opening young eyes to intersectionality       The program is designed to progress for four years, so students can find the causes they resonate with and work with their chosen community long-term.      ""We kind of flipped the model in school,"" said Michael Guinness, BSM's senior Service and Sustainability curriculum coordinator. ""I think too often we make assumptions about communities and about people who are underprivileged, or even an ecosystem that's underprivileged, and we don't give them the space to tell us what's going on.""      Instead of a one-and-done activity, the school focused on facilitating more authentic and collaborative experiences for both students and partner communities. This way, the students get a broader picture, seeing how larger factors like the environment or economy are entangled with these sectors' narratives.      ""It builds that long-term ability to truly understand these communities that we're working with, and make sure that we're working alongside them, not 'to' them or 'at' them. The heart of doing that is knowing that the people in these communities are the experts in their own problems.""

<p>PALAWAN, Philippines – Sweltering temperatures during dry months prompted sustainability projects in Puerto Princesa City supporting birds and wildlife, emphasizing the interdependence of humans and nature.</p>



<p>Puerto Princesa City, through its City Environment and Natural Resources Office (City ENRO) established an arboretum, a botanical collection of trees within the city’s nature park near the New City Hall which will house both endemic and native trees. The establishment of this arboretum started during a yearly event that nurtures Balayong trees within the city&#8217;s Balayong People&#8217;s Park back in July 2023.</p>



<p>Carlo Gomez, City Environment and Natural Resources Officer, said the arboretum will serve as a center for research and a bioreserve that will potentially attract visitors, students, and researchers. </p>



<p>Gomez emphasized that their office focused on planting endemic, native, or fruit-bearing trees because it supports biodiversity and wildlife.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These include the Inyam tree, the fruit of which is a favorite food of birds. Narra, the Philippines&#8217; national tree, also attracts plenty of insects for pollination due to its fragrant flowers and leaves. Banaba and Bani trees too, with their flowers and canopies attracted pollinators like bees.</p>



<p>The Kamuning tree is also found in the arboretum. Kamuning is known scientifically as Murraya paniculata and is considered a medicinal plant used for gas pains, sprain, bone pain, and snake bites. In Malaysia, its leaves are widely used as food flavor additives for cuisine, specifically in preparing meat, fish, and soup and flavor curries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Endemic trees are those only found in Palawan, including the endemic ironwood species known as Palawan Mangkono (Xanthostemon speciosus).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other trees that Puerto Princesa City ENRO is prioritizing were native trees known in their local names as Bakawan Gubat, Agoho, Alalod, Balayong, Balite, Batino, Bignay, Bayok, Bogo, Burawis, Bunog, Dao, Ipil, Iniol, Gatasan, Duguan, Kalantas, Kasoy, Lapnisan, Langka, Lanite, Lumaraw&nbsp; Malabagtik, Malakatmon, Malabakawan, Mulawin, Pangi, Pasi, Putian, Red Nato, Repetek, Sahing, Siar, Talisay, Talisay gubat, Taluto, Ururingin, Tanabag, White Nato, among others, said Forester Sheryl Ampas-Paed.</p>



<p>Senior Environmental Management Specialist (SEMS) Forester Zorina C. Arellano, who heads City ENRO’s Forest Management Division said that native trees are linked to the well-being of insects, birds, and wildlife species that naturally occur in an area, thus it is important to consider native trees compared to exotic and introduced trees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She explained that native trees, especially fruiting trees support wildlife and biodiversity like mammals, avian species, bees, and others that form part of the biodiversity. Native trees should be planted and not an invasive introduced species, which might limit biodiversity. Invasive species will dominate an area and cause other trees to vanish.</p>



<p>“Native trees are their habitats, and these birds and wildlife are dependent on them,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-protecting-the-birds-too"">Protecting the birds, too</h5>



<p>Environmental Management Specialist Myla Adriano said that in order to intensify public awareness campaigns they conducted puppet shows in schools and the barangays as part of raising student’s awareness of the importance of birds and wildlife. </p>



<p>She emphasized the need to protect wildlife habitats as they are the animals&#8217; sources of food, For instance, the endemic Palawan hornbill (Anthracoceros marchei) is a large forest bird that is only found in Palawan. Also endemic in Palawan is the iconic Palawan Peacock Pheasant, locally known as the tandikan.&nbsp; </p>



<p>She explained that birds also take seeds and disperse them through their droppings, therefore bringing plants back to ecosystems that have been destroyed.</p>



<p>Gerald Opiala, a government employee and a landscape designer explained that in landscaping it is important to incorporate water which is vital to birds and wildlife’s existence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Landscape with a bird bath or any water features supports wildlife, especially birds and other avian species affected by dry weather and scarcity of water.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Meron bird bath kasi ang mga ibon ay nag-su-suffer during drought kaya may mitigation measures tayo. Yun ang support natin sa wildlife natin lalo na sa mga ibon. Ito yung obligation po natin sa nature kasi itong bird bath ay iniinuman din ng mga birds kasi nahihirapan yan sila kung may drought lalo na dito sa urban areas,”</em> he explained. (There’s a bird bath because birds suffer during drought and these are some mitigation measures. This is our support to our wildlife and birds. This is our obligation to nature because birds drink water in our bird baths, especially during droughts in urban areas)</p>



<p>Birds and avian species play an important role in our ecosystem, emphasized Gomez who is also a professional birder and bird photographer, being an official of the Wild Bird Photographers of the Philippines (WBPP). &nbsp;</p>



<p>He explained that they are indicators of a healthy environment.</p>

2619785,iloilo-city-government-offers-incentives-households-shifting-solar-power,Iloilo City offers incentives to households shifting to solar power,"
<p>CEBU, Philippines – As part of efforts to alleviate a persistent spate of power outages across the region, Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas said Monday, March 11, they will offer incentives to residents who augment their electricity needs by installing solar panels in their homes. </p>



<p>In a press conference Monday, the mayor said in a mix of English and Hiligaynon: “Residential houses that are solar-powered, equivalent to (twenty) percent of their monthly consumption, as certified by MORE (Power), can get an additional discount of twenty percent off their (real property tax). ”</p>



<p>Treñas emphasized that only households, and not commercial buildings, can avail of the tax incentives. According to the mayor, commercial establishments need to use renewable energy sources more than residential units due to their large energy consumption.</p>



<p>The city government program is actually just implementing an ordinance passed over a decade ago. </p>



<p>The Sangguniang Panlungsod passed Iloilo City Regulation Ordinance No. 2009-358 in November 2009.</p>



<p>Titled &#8220;An Ordinance Encouraging All Household Entities to Utilize Natural Energy from Renewable Resources,&#8221; it provided tax incentives to households which will switch to using &#8220;equipment that harnesses biomass, geothermal, hydropower sources, or utilize solar, wind, ocean, or hybrid energy systems.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, because of the absence of implementing rules and regulations (IRR), the city council suspended the implementation of the ordinance and the tax incentives in February 2023.</p>

<p>On May 19, 2023, Treñas signed Executive Order No. 63, which finally approved the ordinance&#8217;s IRR and enabled its implementation.</p>



<p>Iloilo has long been installing solar panels in public buildings and schools. More residents are also applying to get tax incentives. </p>



<p>Since January, parts of Western Visayas has experienced a series of power outages which Treñas said has affected the livelihood and welfare of residents in the region.  The the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), in a statement, said that the most recent blackout on March 1 was caused by a tripping of Panay’s major power plants.</p>

In a press conference Monday, the mayor said in a mix of English and Hiligaynon: ""Residential houses that are solar-powered, equivalent to (twenty) percent of their monthly consumption, as certified by MORE (Power), can get an additional discount of twenty percent off their (real property tax). ""      Trenas emphasized that only households, and not commercial buildings, can avail of the tax incentives. According to the mayor, commercial establishments need to use renewable energy sources more than residential units due to their large energy consumption.      The city government program is actually just implementing an ordinance passed over a decade ago.       The Sangguniang Panlungsod passed Iloilo City Regulation Ordinance No. 2009-358 in November 2009.      Titled ""An Ordinance Encouraging All Household Entities to Utilize Natural Energy from Renewable Resources,"" it provided tax incentives to households which will switch to using ""equipment that harnesses biomass, geothermal, hydropower sources, or utilize solar, wind, ocean, or hybrid energy systems.""      However, because of the absence of implementing rules and regulations (IRR), the city council suspended the implementation of the ordinance and the tax incentives in February 2023.

Iloilo has long been installing solar panels in public buildings and schools. More residents are also applying to get tax incentives.       Since January, parts of Western Visayas has experienced a series of power outages which Trenas said has affected the livelihood and welfare of residents in the region.  The the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), in a statement, said that the most recent blackout on March 1 was caused by a tripping of Panay's major power plants.

<p>MANILA, Philippines – In today&#8217;s late-stage capitalist world, can big businesses truly be a force for good? PHINMA Corporation and the De La Salle University (DLSU) have partnered up to launch a new research center hoping to prove just that.</p>



<p>The two institutions formally launched the PHINMA-DLSU Center for Business and Society (PDCBS) on Friday, March 8, in front of a crowd of business leaders and academics hopeful that making money can come alongside – or even come as a result of – doing good.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, there is that observation that capitalism has a bad name. Business is greed. Everything that business people are concerned about is making money, and they don&#8217;t care about what&#8217;s happening to society. I guess we&#8217;re trying to address that as well,&#8221; PHINMA chairman and chief executive officer Ramon del Rosario Jr. said on Friday.</p>



<p>&#8220;If we want a better society, we need to do our part,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can see from the audience there – top people in the companies – you can see that they are enthusiastic about this.&#8221;</p>



<p>So what exactly does the PDCBS intend to do? DLSU president Brother Bernard Oca, FSC, said that the research center could bring businesses and the academe together by sharing data and best practices, and by building future business leaders who think &#8220;for the common good, not just for profit.&#8221;</p>



<p>In particular, the center will develop tools, materials, and &#8220;Filipino teaching cases&#8221; to enhance the curriculum of DLSU&#8217;s Ramon V. del Rosario College of Business, initially. This will be eventually disseminated to other PHINMA schools, followed by the general business school community. The center will also produce publications, conferences, and discussion groups centered on the idea of using business as a force for good.</p>



<p>The center will get its seed money from a P50-million donation from PHINMA and Del Rosario&#8217;s family, an amount that the chairman admitted was &#8220;somewhat modest.&#8221; More funding could flow in from research grants and other &#8220;multilateral agencies who like this idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Patrick Aure, director of the PDCBS, it&#8217;s time for business to go beyond merely making as much money as possible. This shift has to start with the way business is taught to students who could one day become the country&#8217;s next leaders.</p>

More importantly, it is for society.&#8221;</p>



<p>Aure said that a business aiming to do good has to go beyond corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs that can just be &#8220;dispensable.&#8221; Instead, Aure emphasized that doing good has to be embedded in the business model. A good example is how some social enterprises &#8220;co-create&#8221; products with a community instead of pumping out products to replace them.

<p>Aure also believes there are &#8220;difficult conversations&#8221; to be had with businesses in industries that are inherently destructive, like mining. This can center around how to minimize the harm from externalities, which are costs borne by society rather than the business.</p>



<p>For instance, Aure said we should ask: If something is bad for the environment, can we stop doing it and think of another innovative business model? If the business is already existing, the next question is: How do we reduce harm?</p>



<p>&#8220;It will be a long cycle. It&#8217;s a very difficult conversation. But I&#8217;d like to focus my efforts on more innovative business models.

<p>MANILA, Philippines – On International Women&#8217;s Day, Friday, March 8, youth groups trooped to the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) to demand the revocation of licenses of teachers who are found to be sexual predators.</p>



<p>Safer Campuses PH, a coalition of student organizations and councils convened with the same advocacy to make schools safe from sexual predators, dropped off a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d72InItwhDxJFKCs4qBdDiqOWDhdRx1Da15kNo0ZVCA/edit"">letter</a> at the PRC addressed to chairperson Charito Zamora. </p>



<p>In the letter, they described the need to revoke professional licenses as teacher-predators have been seen to get away with abuse by simply resigning before a case prospers, and moving on to teach at another school.</p>



<p>&#8220;The celebration of International Women’s Day is marked by the grim reality of campus predators and enablers preying on vulnerable students. Despite legislation such as the Safe Spaces Act, students remain unsafe while unscrupulous individuals and institutions are yet to be made accountable for their crimes,&#8221; the coalition said in the letter.</p>



<p>Janae Vizcarra, Samahan ng Progresibong Kabataan (Spark) Intra-Taft Coordinator, was one of the coalition&#8217;s representatives in dropping off the letter at the PRC building in Sampaloc, Manila. </p>



<p>She recalled how guards badgered the representatives about needing a rally permit to give speeches outside the building. The building on P. Paredes was one corner away from the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/rapplerdotcom/posts/pfbid02muykZgT4upjhLWC8pApyjnUQZdhEh3t1E7yw51MUqfKTe6vRXjspL5oRdSTkHwcKl"">main Women&#8217;s Day rally</a> along Nicanor Reyes street. The main rally concluded just moments before the youth groups walked straight to PRC.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>May nakasunod na guard sa amin hanggang office, kahit kausap na kami ng nagre-receive, doon lang siya nakabuntot sa &#8216;min, tapos nasasabihan kami, paulit-ulit, &#8216;Dapat kasi may permit kayo</em>,'&#8221; Vizcarra told Rappler.</p>



<p>(A guard was following us until the office, even when we were talking to the person who would receive our letter, the guard just stayed at our tails. And he kept telling us repeatedly, &#8220;You should have a permit.&#8221;)</p>



<p>Spark secretary general Pat Racca said the group was still optimistic that the PRC would respond positively to their appeal.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Kasi sino ba&#8217;ng hindi kakampi sa mga biktima? Mga enabler lang naman, o &#8216;di kaya mga kapwa predator. Tingin ko naman hindi ganoon ang PRC,</em>&#8221; she said. (Because who would not side with victims? Just enablers, or fellow predators. I believe PRC is not like that.)</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-impunity-in-schools"">Impunity in schools</h5>



<p>In a statement on Friday, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya313dvzpxg"">Enough Is Enough</a>, a convening member organization of Safer Campuses PH, said that the group monitored 61 schools with campus predators, many of whom reportedly remain employed in the schools, or have transferred to different schools without facing administrative and criminal charges.</p>



<p>Racca of Spark said that in cases they have monitored, when victim-survivors are able to bring themselves to report the abuse, school administrations have reportedly told them that they cannot proceed with the cases because the accused teachers resigned.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Nagresign, intact ang benefits, intact ang lisensya, walang records sa crime na nangyari, kasi hindi naman umandar &#8216;yung kaso. Malalaman na lang na nasa eskwelahan na pala,</em>&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>(They resigned, their benefits are intact, their licenses are intact, and there are no records of the crime that happened, because the case did not prosper. You only find out later that they are teaching in a new school.)</p>

2617403,cebu-teachers-students-oppose-opening-education-foreign-ownership,"Cebu teachers, students oppose foreign ownership of Philippine schools","
<p>CEBU, Philippines – Some teacher and student groups in Cebu expressed their opposition to proposed amendments in the 1987 Constitution that would allow full foreign ownership of educational institutions. </p>



<p>“Such a proposal further reinforces the neoliberal ‘users pay’ philosophy which for decades has commercialized the system of education in the country,” the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) Philippines Cebu said on Wednesday, March 6.</p>



<p>The teachers&#8217; organization warned that once restrictions on foreign ownership in the education sector ease, issues such as tuition fee hikes and &#8220;biased revisions&#8221; to the curriculum would emerge. </p>



<p>“This means the worsening of historical revisionism as foreign capitalist educators, many of whom could be coming from the country’s former colonial masters, could design curriculum and instruction that would further their neocolonial interests in the country,” their statement read.</p>



<p>The National Union of Students of the Philippines shared similar sentiments, saying the proposed amendments would only intensify foreign influence in Philippine education.</p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Factregion7union%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02SMcV4s6iR94yAULNbvctxsZx3RZU9yurBY8aWZhppvm1yMqz7QsKURBcoNcZFLgvl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""250"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p>The Department of Education (DepEd) already objected to the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/eager-start-charter-change-discussions-lawmakers-file-resolution-both-houses/"">proposed amendments</a> during a House deliberation on Resolution of Both Houses (RBH) No. 7 on Monday, March 4.</p>



<p>&#8220;The scope and limits of control and administration are put into question, including processes defining who, what, and how education shall be administered. The most basic question is – will it allow foreign entities to teach?&#8221; DepEd Undersecretary Omar Alexander Romero said.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, March 5, Senator Sonny Angara said during a Senate sub-committee hearing that the amendments do not intend to open Philippine basic education to foreign investments, only higher, tertiary, technical and vocational education.</p>



<p>&#8220;We need more clarity in the language because the intention is not to liberalize basic education,&#8221; Angara said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-learning-crisis""><strong>Learning crisis</strong></h5>



<p>For Kabataan Cebu chapter chairperson John Kyle Enero, allowing full foreign ownership of schools would only worsen the existing learning crisis that the country is facing.</p>



<p>To recall, the Philippines placed <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/why-filipino-students-lagging-behind-global-assessments-tests/"">77th out of 81 countries</a> in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 rankings for 15-year-old students’ average performances on mathematics, science and reading.</p>



<p>Based on the 2022 rankings of the Program for International Student Assessment, the Philippines is among the nations that produced the lowest proficiency for 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science, placing 77th out of 81 countries.</p>



<p>“As it currently stands, history, culture, language, and other similar civics subjects are already being trimmed down in Filipino-owned schools. Under full foreign ownership, all of these could be removed in favor of more marketable topics,” Enero said.</p>

<p>Enero also criticized Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Chairman Prospero de Vera III for saying that the proposed easing of foreign ownership restrictions on education would improve the global competitiveness of institutions.</p>



<p>“What CHED is actually saying is the government would rather export young, cheap, and docile labor to other transnational corporations and foreign countries, rather than provide quality and accessible education and decent jobs and wages,” Enero said.</p>

<p>Ryan Dave Ryla, a college lecturer at a private university in Cebu City, told Rappler that opening the education sector to foreign companies would be akin to “passing the buck.”</p>



<p>“Instead of opening up the education sector to foreign competition, it would be best for the state to strengthen its public education system,” he said.</p>

","<p>A progressive teachers&#8217; group warns that historical revisionism may worsen if foreign capitalist educators will be allowed to fully own educational institutions in the Philippines</p>

""Such a proposal further reinforces the neoliberal 'users pay' philosophy which for decades has commercialized the system of education in the country,"" the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) Philippines Cebu said on Wednesday, March 6.      The teachers' organization warned that once restrictions on foreign ownership in the education sector ease, issues such as tuition fee hikes and ""biased revisions"" to the curriculum would emerge.       ""This means the worsening of historical revisionism as foreign capitalist educators, many of whom could be coming from the country's former colonial masters, could design curriculum and instruction that would further their neocolonial interests in the country,"" their statement read.      The National Union of Students of the Philippines shared similar sentiments, saying the proposed amendments would only intensify foreign influence in Philippine education.              The Department of Education (DepEd) already objected to the  proposed amendments  during a House deliberation on Resolution of Both Houses (RBH) No. 7 on Monday, March 4.      ""The scope and limits of control and administration are put into question, including processes defining who, what, and how education shall be administered. The most basic question is - will it allow foreign entities to teach?"" DepEd Undersecretary Omar Alexander Romero said.      On Tuesday, March 5, Senator Sonny Angara said during a Senate sub-committee hearing that the amendments do not intend to open Philippine basic education to foreign investments, only higher, tertiary, technical and vocational education.      ""We need more clarity in the language because the intention is not to liberalize basic education,"" Angara said.       Learning crisis       For Kabataan Cebu chapter chairperson John Kyle Enero, allowing full foreign ownership of schools would only worsen the existing learning crisis that the country is facing.      To recall, the Philippines placed  77th out of 81 countries  in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 rankings for 15-year-old students' average performances on mathematics, science and reading.      Based on the 2022 rankings of the Program for International Student Assessment, the Philippines is among the nations that produced the lowest proficiency for 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science, placing 77th out of 81 countries.      ""As it currently stands, history, culture, language, and other similar civics subjects are already being trimmed down in Filipino-owned schools. Under full foreign ownership, all of these could be removed in favor of more marketable topics,"" Enero said.                       Must Read                          Why Filipino students performed poorly in global learning assessments                                                                                         Enero also criticized Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Chairman Prospero de Vera III for saying that the proposed easing of foreign ownership restrictions on education would improve the global competitiveness of institutions.      ""What CHED is actually saying is the government would rather export young, cheap, and docile labor to other transnational corporations and foreign countries, rather than provide quality and accessible education and decent jobs and wages,"" Enero said.                   Play  Video                     Passing the buck      Ryan Dave Ryla, a college lecturer at a private university in Cebu City, told Rappler that opening the education sector to foreign companies would be akin to ""passing the buck.""      ""Instead of opening up the education sector to foreign competition, it would be best for the state to strengthen its public education system,"" he said.      Lloyd Manango, vice chairperson of the League of Filipino Students, said during the deliberation on RBH No. 7 on Tuesday that the government has yet to fully utilize options in meeting international education standards.

It was posted in a Facebook group with 619,800 members by ""DS WD,"" a Facebook page bearing the logo of the Department of Social Welfare and Development.       The post features the DepEd logo and a picture of Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte. Interested applicants are instructed to register through the application link provided in the post.              The facts:  The supposed allowance for elementary students is fake, similar to previously debunked posts promoting various fake scholarship programs allegedly offered by the education department.        DepEd, in a tweet on  March 6 , flagged the said content as fake.        ""The Department of Education (DepEd) warns the public about FAKE posts claiming that they give out ""pang baon"" for Grade 1 to 6 learners. Parents are strongly advised not to give out their children's school information and identification to these kinds of hideous posts so as not to compromise their security,"" the tweet said.      In  January , DepEd clarified in a statement that it does not provide a monthly allowance to students, but instead provides subsidies to cover the tuition fees of eligible students.        DepEd subsidies:  According to DepEd, these are their current programs to support learners:          Education Contracting Service  – a program that provides financial subsidies to qualified junior high school students in private schools.        Senior High School (SHS) Voucher Program  – a program giving subsidies to qualified SHS learners in private schools.        Joint Delivery Voucher Program  – a program that gives tuition fee assistance to grade 12 students taking the technical-vocational livelihood (TVL) track in public senior high schools ""which have been identified as having inadequate facilities, equipment, tools, and teachers relevant to the implementation of TVL specializations.""        None of these programs provide a monthly allowance to elementary students.        Blogging page:  The link provided in the post does not redirect to the  official DepEd website  or any Philippine government webpage. Instead, it goes to a blogging site that asks individuals for their private information, including full name, birthdate, mobile number, email address, and home address. These personal details may potentially be used for phishing scams.

2616282,san-carlos-bishop-alminaza-calls-end-violent-political-gun-culture-negros,"San Carlos bishop calls for end to violent political, gun culture in Negros","
<p>BACOLOD, Philippines – As Negrenses marked the first death anniversary of Negros Oriental governor Roel Degamo, on Monday, March 4,&nbsp; Bishop Gerardo &#8220;Gerry&#8221;&nbsp;Alminaza&nbsp;of the Diocese of San Carlos City, called for the immediate end to what he said was Negros Island&#8217;s violence-prone political and gun culture. </p>



<p>Bishop&nbsp;Alminaza&nbsp;said&nbsp;a year after the merciless killings of Degamo and companions, &#8220;our call remains the same: Justice!&#8221; He added: &#8220;Our dream of integral peace is still elusive.&#8221;</p>



<p>Degamo and nine others were killled by armed men inside the compound of&nbsp; the governor&#8217;s residence in Barangay 9, Pamplona town in Negros Oriental at around 9 am on March 4, 2023.</p>



<p>The assassination in broad daylight angered NegrOrenses who then demanded for justice for their beloved governor, and the pursuit of peace in the Negros community.</p>



<p>But&nbsp;Alminaza&nbsp;said, until now, Negrenses are still &#8220;crying&#8221; for genuine peace as Negros Island continues to be at the center of violent conflict.</p>



<p>&#8220;A violence-ridden political culture must end in society. It will never guarantee authentic development for our country,&#8221; said the outspoken bishop.</p>



<p>What Negros really wants, Alminaza said, is peace &#8220;without any stain of blood and violence.&#8221;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-fake-solutions"">Fake solutions</h5>



<p>The prelate also criticized what he described as institutionalization of fake solutions in disguise of achieving peace in the island.</p>



<p>&#8220;To be clear, peace can not be achieved by political means, by using weaponry or by institutionalizing fake solutions. When we talk for peace, it starts by disarming for peace,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Alminaza suggested ways to achieve genuine and lasting peace in Negros. These are:</p>



<ul>
<li>end gun culture,</li>



<li>campaign to surrender and regulate gun ownership,</li>



<li>abolish private armies or &#8220;bodyguard system&#8221;,</li>



<li>institutionalize peace and development through schools without any form of militarization,</li>



<li>restore the initiated peace talks,</li>



<li>mandate the justice system to end impunity, and</li>



<li>conclude political dynasty.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-anti-christ"">&#8216;Anti-Christ&#8217;</h5>



<p>The bishop admitted that by putting forward these suggestions for the sake of attaining peace in Negros, he could be branded as demonic or &#8220;anti-Christ&#8221;.</p>



<p>But he said he will never tire of calling for peace although this kind of demand to protect every citizen is the primordial work of the government.</p>



<p>He also said that the police and the military must not be selective and should not allow themselves to be used in politics or specific interests.</p>

<p>But no, the EMBO parishes won’t move to the Diocese of Pasig.</p>



<p>Father Reginald Malicdem, vicar general and spokesperson of the Archdiocese of Manila, told Rappler on Monday, March 4: “The five parishes in the EMBO barangays will remain in the Archdiocese of Manila. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction does not necessarily follow the civil jurisdiction.”</p>



<p>The following are the Catholic parishes in the EMBO barangays, according to Malicdem:</p>



<ul>
<li>Saint John Mary Vianney Parish, Cembo</li>



<li>Mater Dolorosa Parish, East Rembo</li>



<li>Santa Teresita Parish, West Rembo</li>



<li>Mary, Mirror of Justice Parish, Comembo</li>



<li>Saint John of the Cross Parish, Pembo</li>
</ul>



<p>While dioceses are named after prominent cities, their composition is oftentimes mixed and – if viewed through the lens of local government units – inconsistent. </p>

<p>MANILA, Philippines – Last Saturday, March 2, the La Salle Lady Spikers took on the Ateneo Blue Eagles in their <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/women-volleyball-game-results-la-salle-lady-spikers-ateneo-blue-eagles-march-2-2024/"">first rivalry showdown</a> of the UAAP Season 86 women&#8217;s volleyball tournament.</p>



<p>Once a must-see showpiece of top-notch skills, the matchup has turned into a one-sided affair in favor of La Salle, which has won 13 straight times stretching over a near seven-year period over Ateneo, including Saturday&#8217;s <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/volleyball-game-results-team-standings-men-women-season-86-2024/"">25-12, 25-22, 25-19</a> blowout.</p>



<p>And as the equality of competition between the two schools waned, so apparently has the fans&#8217; interest.</p>



<p>Saturday&#8217;s match only saw 6,477 fans, and while the number is low by Ateneo-La Salle standards, what&#8217;s more noteworthy is that the Lady Spikers&#8217; fans overwhelmingly outnumbered the Blue Eagles&#8217; supporters – around a 90-10 split by the eye test. </p>



<p>The ear test was even worse, with La Salle&#8217;s booming kill blocks triggering massive cheers while Ateneo&#8217;s valiant efforts were met with soft, scattered applause.</p>

<p>In the Philippines, chances are the viand for one’s meal is pork or has some pork in it. One of the most popular, of course, is the Philippine dish <em>adobo</em>, which can either be pork adobo or chicken adobo. &nbsp;</p>

Jire Carreon/Rappler</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pork is so influential in Philippine cuisine that the country made the Guinness World Records for &#8220;most varieties of pork dishes on display&#8221; in one event. The title was achieved by the National Federation of Hog Farmers Incorporated at the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/filipino-hog-farmers-set-guinness-world-record-most-variety-pork-dishes/"">National Hog Festival 2024</a> held at the Gateway Mall in Araneta City, Quezon City on Friday, March 1. The event seeks to support Filipino hog farmers and highlight Philippine pork cuisine. </p>



<p>“Filipinos are basically pork eaters,” said the Department of Agriculture’s Philippine Hog Industry Roadmap 2022 to 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pork is the Filipino family&#8217;s main source of protein, and is generally preferred over other protein sources such as chicken meat, beef, fish, and legumes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Filipino’s love for pork will remain because of the meat’s versatility as a preferred dish for nearly every memorable event with friends and family,” said Pilmico, a food and agribusiness subsidiary of the Aboitiz Group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD) of the Department of Science and Technology said swine provides around 60% of total animal meat consumption of Fiipinos. Swine production ranks next to rice in terms of total value of agricultural production, it said in a 2016 article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the average, Filipinos eat more pork than the world average. The Philippines’ meat consumption in 2021 was around 15 kilograms (kg) per capita compared to the world average of roughly 11 kg per capita.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/166870-fast-facts-meat-chicken-pork-filipino-consumption/"">FAST FACTS: How much meat does the Filipino consume?</a></p>



<p>Before <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/topic/african-swine-fever/"">African Swine Fever</a> (ASF) severely affected the country’s swine industry starting in July 2019, hogs were the number one livestock produced by the country. In 2018, for instance, the country’s hog production was 2.3 million metric tons (MT) followed by chicken at 1.8 million MT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roughly 70% of hogs in the Philippines come from backyard or small producers, and 30% come from commercial farms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pigs are sold in markets as live animal or as pork. Pork is processed into food such as ham, bacon, and sausages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest hog producers are Western Visayas (11.8%), Davao Region (10%), Zamboanga Peninsula (9.7%), and Bicol Region (9.5%). These five regions account for 55.8% of production of backyard/small producers. </p>



<p>Commercial hog producers are concentrated in the CALABARZON or Southern Tagalog Region, led by Batangas province.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Philippines’ average annual inventory of hogs is 12 million heads. However, due mainly to the ASF, total swine inventory was <a href=""https://psa.gov.ph/livestock-poultry-iprs/swine/production"">down to 9.86 million heads in September 2023</a>, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The more than 300 dishes prepared in the National Hog Festival 2024 represent the diversity of Philippine pork cuisine since most of the dishes were local.&nbsp;</p>

","<p>Philippine pork cuisine and the Filipinos&#8217; love for pork are highlighted in the National Hog Festival 2024 where 313 pork dishes were accepted by the Guinness World Records. Here&#8217;s a list of most of the dishes. </p>

A list of the 300-plus pork dishes that got the Philippines a Guinness World Record,"  MANILA, Philippines -  Anong ulam?  (What's the viand?)       In the Philippines, chances are the viand for one's meal is pork or has some pork in it. One of the most popular, of course, is the Philippine dish  adobo , which can either be pork adobo or chicken adobo.        Another mouth-watering pork dish, made famous globally by the  late Anthony Bourdain , is  lechon , which is often served in fiestas and big celebrations.         LECHON. A Sinigang sa Lechon is one of the pork dishes served at the National Hog Festival 2024 in Gateway Mall, Araneta City, where the Philippines copped the Guinness World Record for most varieties of pork dishes on display, on March 1, 2024. Jire Carreon/Rappler       Pork is so influential in Philippine cuisine that the country made the Guinness World Records for ""most varieties of pork dishes on display"" in one event. The title was achieved by the National Federation of Hog Farmers Incorporated at the  National Hog Festival 2024  held at the Gateway Mall in Araneta City, Quezon City on Friday, March 1. The event seeks to support Filipino hog farmers and highlight Philippine pork cuisine.       ""Filipinos are basically pork eaters,"" said the Department of Agriculture's Philippine Hog Industry Roadmap 2022 to 2026.       Pork is the Filipino family's main source of protein, and is generally preferred over other protein sources such as chicken meat, beef, fish, and legumes.       ""The Filipino's love for pork will remain because of the meat's versatility as a preferred dish for nearly every memorable event with friends and family,"" said Pilmico, a food and agribusiness subsidiary of the Aboitiz Group.       The Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD) of the Department of Science and Technology said swine provides around 60% of total animal meat consumption of Fiipinos. Swine production ranks next to rice in terms of total value of agricultural production, it said in a 2016 article.       On the average, Filipinos eat more pork than the world average. The Philippines' meat consumption in 2021 was around 15 kilograms (kg) per capita compared to the world average of roughly 11 kg per capita.        FAST FACTS: How much meat does the Filipino consume?       Before  African Swine Fever  (ASF) severely affected the country's swine industry starting in July 2019, hogs were the number one livestock produced by the country. In 2018, for instance, the country's hog production was 2.3 million metric tons (MT) followed by chicken at 1.8 million MT.       Roughly 70% of hogs in the Philippines come from backyard or small producers, and 30% come from commercial farms.       Pigs are sold in markets as live animal or as pork. Pork is processed into food such as ham, bacon, and sausages.       The biggest hog producers are Western Visayas (11.8%), Davao Region (10%), Zamboanga Peninsula (9.7%), and Bicol Region (9.5%). These five regions account for 55.8% of production of backyard/small producers.       Commercial hog producers are concentrated in the CALABARZON or Southern Tagalog Region, led by Batangas province.       The Philippines' average annual inventory of hogs is 12 million heads. However, due mainly to the ASF, total swine inventory was  down to 9.86 million heads in September 2023 , according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).       Diversity and foreign influence      The more than 300 dishes prepared in the National Hog Festival 2024 represent the diversity of Philippine pork cuisine since most of the dishes were local.         RECORD. Sonia Ushirogochi, an official adjudicator of Guinness World Records, checks the more than 300 pork dishes in Gateway Mall, Araneta City, Cubao, Quezon City on Friday, March 1, 2024. Jire Carreon/Rappler       Among these are pork sisig, menudo, pochero, pork binagoongan, lechon, pork laing, embotido, pork adobo, pork sinigang, pork kinilaw, bagnet, lechon paksiw, dinuguan, pork tocino, pork morcon, pork dinuguna, pork menudo, pork afritada, picadillo, chicharon, and longganisa.       Among the Chinese pork dishes were siomai, sweet and sour pork, char siew, and dumpling.       Other Asian pork dishes presented were Indonesian Pork Satay, Vietnamese Pork Chop, Thai-style Grilled Pork, and Japan's Tonkatsu. There were also German pork dishes.       Among the companies, restaurants, and schools that joined the Guinness World Record attempt were: Tunglok Seafood, Chef Laudico Guevarra's, Mesa, Tim Ho Wan, Pound x Flatterie, Hawker Chan, Lyceum of the Philippines University, Little Chinatown, Perpetual Help College Manila, Robina Farms, Universal Robina, Del Monte, and Cargill Philippines.       A total of 341 dishes were displayed during the Guinness World Record attempt, 28 were disqualified. The total number of pork dishes that made it to the final list is 313.               Rappler obtained a partial list of the over 300 dishes. The list is still incomplete and includes 28 dishes that were disqualified since they were considered duplicates. We will update the list once we get the information.

2614959,women-volleyball-game-results-la-salle-lady-spikers-ateneo-blue-eagles-march-2-2024,&#8216;Not their time yet&#8217;: De Jesus keeps Ateneo respect high amid La Salle 13-game win streak,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – No lucky breaks, just hard work.</p>



<p>Amid his legendary 27-year career, 12-time UAAP champion coach Ramil de Jesus was never one to underestimate any opponent of his La Salle Lady Spikers, and he is not keen to start now.</p>



<p>After the defending champions imposed their height and skill for the 13th straight time against longtime rival Ateneo on Saturday, March 2, De Jesus maintained that the Blue Eagles are not a team to be disregarded despite lagging near the bottom of the standings to kick off Season 86.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not looking at the numbers,&#8221; the iconic mentor said in Filipino after La Salle hosted a one-sided block party over Ateneo to the tune of a <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/volleyball-game-results-team-standings-men-women-season-86-2024/"">25-12, 25-22, 25-19</a> sweep, extending a near seven-year streak dating back to Season 79.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoever comes before us, we&#8217;ll prepare for them, whether it&#8217;s Ateneo, UST, FEU. All schools are big games for us. If it just so happened that our winning tradition against Ateneo is already that long, maybe it&#8217;s just not their time yet to win against us.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, the talent difference was quite obvious from the get-go, but La Salle still made it a point to play its best from buzzer to buzzer.</p>



<p>Thea Gagate led the towering Lady Spikers defense as usual with 15 points on 9 attacks, a season-high 5 blocks, and 1 ace, while Shevana Laput bounced back from a long benching against UST with 13 points.</p>



<p>Reigning MVP Angel Canino, following a 28-point effort in the five-set <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/women-volleyball-game-results-ust-golden-tigresses-la-salle-lady-spikers-february-25-2024/"">shock loss</a> to the Golden Tigresses, took a backseat with 10 points as she let her teammates shine with 12 blocks against Ateneo.</p>



<p>&#8220;Actually, Ateneo is very promising,&#8221; De Jesus continued. &#8220;You cannot joke around them. You need to prepare every set and give them respect, even though they are young.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sure enough, the Blue Eagles have intriguing pieces despite what is currently another losing season. </p>



<p>Lyann De Guzman, who erupted for 24 points, 18 excellent receptions, and 11 excellent digs in a five-set, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/women-volleyball-game-results-ateneo-blue-eagles-up-fighting-maroons-february-28-2024/"">reverse sweep</a> of UP, followed up with 15 on 13 spikes, 1 block, and 1 ace against La Salle.</p>



<p>Sobe Buena, though limited to 5 points against the Lady Spikers, still showed big promise with 18 in her last outing.</p>



<p>This iteration of the Blue Eagles is no doubt a far cry from the Ateneo&#8217;s best rosters in its title-winning glory years, but the talent is still there.</p>



<p>Maybe it will not happen today or in the next few years, but the Eagles will one day soar again. Even their most heated rivals know it. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

Reigning MVP Angel Canino, following a 28-point effort in the five-set  shock loss  to the Golden Tigresses, took a backseat with 10 points as she let her teammates shine with 12 blocks against Ateneo.      ""Actually, Ateneo is very promising,"" De Jesus continued. ""You cannot joke around them. You need to prepare every set and give them respect, even though they are young.""      Sure enough, the Blue Eagles have intriguing pieces despite what is currently another losing season.       Lyann De Guzman, who erupted for 24 points, 18 excellent receptions, and 11 excellent digs in a five-set,  reverse sweep  of UP, followed up with 15 on 13 spikes, 1 block, and 1 ace against La Salle.      Sobe Buena, though limited to 5 points against the Lady Spikers, still showed big promise with 18 in her last outing.      This iteration of the Blue Eagles is no doubt a far cry from the Ateneo's best rosters in its title-winning glory years, but the talent is still there.      Maybe it will not happen today or in the next few years, but the Eagles will one day soar again. Even their most heated rivals know it.  - Rappler.com   ",Neutral
2611807,why-reverting-old-academic-school-calendar-just-stopgap-measure,Why reverting to old academic calendar is just a &#8216;stopgap&#8217; measure,"
<p class=""has-drop-cap"">In 2023, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/students-school-cabuyao-laguna-sent-hospital-dehydration-fire-drill-march-2023/"">over a hundred students</a> of a public school in Laguna were hospitalized due to dehydration after a surprise fire drill. </p>



<p>The school official said the temperature when the fire drill happened on March 23, 2023 was between 39 and 42°C. It was very hot and humid. In a tropical country like the Philippines, where classrooms are not built to withstand extreme heat, conditions are not conducive to learning. </p>



<p>Classes in the Philippines typically begin on the first Monday of June concluding in March, as mandated by Republic Act 7797. But in 2020, this law was amended to accommodate changes in school opening schedules. Classes should start not later than the last day of August, the new law said.</p>



<p>The country made the adjustment due to the impact of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown in 2020. But even prior to the pandemic, there had been calls to make the academic calendar in the Philippines synchronized with other countries, especially with its Southeast Asian counterparts. Proponents of the shift also said that the months of June and July coincide with the typhoon season, resulting in class disruptions.</p>



<p>Since then, the academic year had shifted to August, meaning, students were now in school from April to May – a time that previously marked their summer vacation in the previous school calendar, and a period when high temperatures were often recorded.</p>



<p>But after a year of full adjustment, public clamor to revert to the old academic calendar intensified. A survey commissioned by Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, chairman of the basic education committee, revealed that 8 in 10 Filipinos want summer breaks back to April and May. This prompted the Department of Education (DepEd) to gradually revert to the old calendar. </p>



<p>&#8220;The shift to the school calendar back to the usual April-May break will be gradual. We will end on May 31, but we will open around July 29. And then slowly, we will move it back until we return to the normal April-May break,&#8221; DepEd Undersecretary Michael Poa said. </p>



<p>Poa said the decision to revert to the old academic calendar was based on consultations done by DepEd. “This is a decision made by the people,” he added.</p>



<p>The education official said that by school year 2026-2027, schools would open in June and end in April, based on DepEd’s projected timeline. By school year 2027-2028, schools would open in June and end by mid-March. </p>



<p>While the reversal of the academic calendar was welcome news to many, education experts said that it was just another &#8220;stopgap&#8221; measure. Meanwhile, for critics, it was just another &#8220;populist&#8221; policy by Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte.  </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-stopgap"">Stopgap</h5>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s more of a stopgap because DepEd couldn&#8217;t address the heat problems in the classrooms, which is the main reason why the public school teachers and students had clamored for the revert,&#8221; said education psychologist and University of the Philippines professor Lizamarie Olegario. </p>



<p>Olegario noted that Filipino students suffer from extreme heat in their classrooms because school buildings do not have &#8220;enough ventilation.&#8221; She enumerated the following issues that need to be addressed instead of reverting to the old calendar. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Limit class size to 40</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Classroom shortages had been a problem even before the pandemic. In some schools,&nbsp;<a href=""https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1126414/school-opening-woes-many-students-few-classrooms"">75 to 80 students were packed</a>&nbsp;into one classroom meant for only 40. To make up for the lack of classrooms, class shifting had been implemented to accommodate enrollees every year. (READ:<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/teachers-students-troop-back-school-2019-greeted-classroom-shortage"">&nbsp;Classroom shortages greet teachers, students in opening of classes</a>)</p>



<p>At a Senate hearing in 2023, it was revealed that DepEd would need P397 billion to address the 159,000 classroom backlog nationwide. Gatchalian also noted that the congestion rate in schools was at 32% for Kinder to Grade 6, 41% in Junior High School, and about 50% in Senior High School.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Enough electric fans </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While electric fans are a common appliance in any Filipino household, there are still classrooms that don&#8217;t have them. </p>



<p>At a separate Senate inquiry in 2023, Senator Raffy Tulfo <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/raffy-tulfo-blasts-deped-why-collect-contributions-students-electric-fans/"">blasted the DepEd</a>&nbsp;for soliciting funds from students – through the Parents-Teachers Association (PTA) – to buy school supplies and appliances such as electric fans for classroom use, as these should be provided by the agency.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Equip teachers with remote learning teaching skills</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>There have been calls to &#8220;institutionalize&#8221; remote or blended learning in Philippine basic education so class suspensions would be lessened in case of typhoons or any natural disasters. </p>



<p>But doing so is not as easy as ABC because access to technology for both teachers and students remains a problem up to this day. Teachers are also not equipped with adequate know-how on how to use technology for learning. </p>

<p>As if the lack of resources for teachers wasn&#8217;t enough, the DepEd even got embroiled in a corruption controversy for purchasing <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/why-commission-audit-flagged-deped-billions-worth-outdated-laptops/"">&#8220;overpriced and outdated&#8221;</a> laptops in 2021. </p>



<p>A separate Rappler investigation also revealed that laptops procured by the agency were being resold in markets. </p>



<p>&#8220;Since it has been decided that basic education reverts to the old calendar, during the rainy season, the teachers and the students should be equipped to have automatic online learning. There should be no need to wait for announcements from local officials for cancellation of classes,&#8221; Olegario said. </p>

<p>In a statement on February 21, the Philippine Business for Education (PBEd) said that with the DepEd&#8217;s move to revert to the old academic calendar, the agency should tap local governments to address issues in the education sector, &#8220;as many of the concerns can be addressed at the local level.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The decision to revert back to the old academic calendar should not be seen as a stopgap measure to address the underlying issues that make the existing school calendar unbearable. To safeguard our children, we need to make sure that classrooms can withstand extreme weather conditions and have transportation support available,&#8221; the group said. </p>



<p>In an interview with Rappler on February 28, PBEd executive director Justine Raagas emphasized that the problem in Philippine basic education is not really the academic calendar. </p>



<p>&#8220;Regardless of the academic school year, one of the biggest problems is, our classrooms are not conducive for learning. The problem goes beyond the shifting measures. The problem is classrooms can&#8217;t withstand typhoons, or classrooms are in very poor conditions that they don&#8217;t allow proper ventilation,&#8221; Raagas said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-learning-loss-due-to-long-break"">Learning loss due to long break</h5>



<p>But another issue that cropped up with the reversal to the old academic calendar is the looming long break for senior high school students going to college. </p>



<p>If by school year 2027-2028, basic education in the Philippines would open in June and end in March, that would mean senior high school graduates would have a five-month break before they enter college. </p>



<p>Raagas fears that the long break would result in learning loss, especially since students&#8217; foundational knowledge isn&#8217;t strong. </p>



<p>&#8220;Learning loss occurs whenever a student is outside the classroom. If you remember in 2020, schools opened late, sometime in October 2020. Even in normal times, where you have two months of summer break, that results in learning loss. That&#8217;s why the first few weeks of the start of classes, it&#8217;s for catch-up, and review of past lessons,&#8221; she noted. </p>



<p>Learning loss, according to the Journal of Education and e-Learning Research, &#8220;occurs when students lose knowledge and skills generally or specifically or there is an academic impediment due to prolonged gaps or the discontinuation of the educational process.&#8221;</p>



<p>With the recent move by DepEd, should the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) also change its academic calendar? Olegario and Raagas don&#8217;t think so. </p>



<p>&#8220;For college, it was done because they want to align with international standards and for better partnership.&nbsp;It could stay that way but the basic education should improve,&#8221; Raagas said, noting that DepEd should improve its teaching quality so the long break would not result in learning loss. </p>



<p>For Olegario, higher education institutions in the Philippines &#8220;do not have problems with ventilation&nbsp;in the classrooms.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of similar issues mentioned by the public school children. I&#8217;ve never seen classes that are too cramped, unlike what I saw in some elementary and public high schools,&#8221; she added. </p>



<p>CHED has not released any statement yet on the recent move by the DepEd.</p>



<p>The public hopes that the revert to the old academic calendar will benefit students and help in learning recovery. </p>



<p>&#8220;If we make the decision, let&#8217;s stick to it. It&#8217;s not fair that we experiment on schedules at the expense of our students. [Our] children require normalcy and stability in their education,&#8221; Raagas said. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>MANILA, Philippines – The Supreme Court (SC) has moved to punish former National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) spokesperson <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/topic/lorraine-badoy/"">Lorraine Badoy</a> for threatening a Manila judge.</p>



<p>In an August 15, 2023 decision that was only published this week, the High Court found Badoy guilty of indirect contempt for her &#8220;vitriolic and outright threats&#8221; against Judge Marlo Magdoza-Malagar. She was also ordered to pay a P30,000 fine and &#8220;WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall merit a more severe sanction.&#8221;</p>

<p>In September 2022, Malagar, who presides over Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 19,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/manila-court-junks-doj-petition-seeking-declare-cpp-npa-terrorists/"">dismissed</a>&nbsp;the years-old petition of the Philippine government seeking to declare the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army as terrorists.

<p>Shortly after the decision was released, Badoy red-tagged the judge and called Malagar a “friend and defender” of the communist rebels.</p>

In an August 15, 2023 decision that was only published this week, the High Court found Badoy guilty of indirect contempt for her ""vitriolic and outright threats"" against Judge Marlo Magdoza-Malagar. She was also ordered to pay a P30,000 fine and ""WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall merit a more severe sanction.""          Senior Associate Justice Leonen wrote the ruling dated August 15, 2023, but was only published by the High Court this week.   This is the latest decision punishing Badoy. In 2023, the OMB also reprimanded her for red-tagging lawyers.  pic.twitter.com/e1Y1XLhCkZ  — Jairo Bolledo (@jairojourno)  February 29, 2024            Under Philippine laws,  indirect contempt  is committed out of the court's presence. Badoy was found guilty for her action that falls under Section 3(d), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court that categorizes indirect contempt as ""any improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice.""      In September 2022, Malagar, who presides over Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 19,  dismissed  the years-old petition of the Philippine government seeking to declare the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army as terrorists. In her decision, Malagar noted the difference between terrorism and rebellion, and that the atrocities in question did not fall under the elements of terrorism as defined by law.      Shortly after the decision was released, Badoy red-tagged the judge and called Malagar a ""friend and defender"" of the communist rebels.      The SC came to Malagar's  rescue and issued a statement , warning that inciting violence against judges may be punishable through contempt. It said that its en banc tackled  motu proprio  (acted on its own) possible actions against Badoy for issuing threats against Malagar.  Judges  and  law schools  also broke their silence and rallied behind Malagar.

<p>PALAWAN, Philippines – Ritchel Caabay, a 38-year-old mother of four, lives in a rented house at Employees Village in the urban barangay of Santa Monica, nine kilometers from Puerto Princesa’s central business district. </p>



<p>Her house is just a few hundred meters from the city hall of Puerto Princesa and existing green spaces, but during the daytime, she finds it difficult to overcome the extreme heat inside her home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She hails from an upland rural barangay in Roxas, Palawan, 176 kilometers from Puerto Princesa. But a few years ago, they relocated to Puerto Princesa where she and her husband found work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since they are renting a poorly designed semi-concrete house with GI sheet roofing without ceilings, and a lack of ventilations, she said they feel that they are inside an oven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is also the same situation with 50-year-old widow Mary Jane Olatan who lives with her children in a small space provided by her employer. She said they need at least four to five electric fans to get relieved from extreme heat inside their living space.</p>



<p>In April 2023, Puerto Princesa recorded a scorching 43 degrees Celsius heat index that caused an alarm to local authorities and citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/explainer-climate-change-effects-human-health-diseases/"">Weather extremes affect</a> low-income communities the most. The reasons include poor housing and the lack of access to safe and comfortable green public spaces. This makes climate readiness a pressing concern for governments, local planners, and health authorities not only in this city, but also in other urbanized towns and cities in the country. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/majority-filipinos-feel-efects-climate-change-pulse-asia-survey-september-2023/"">Weather conditions and immoderations driven by climate change</a> have compelled the Puerto Princesa City government to re-design its greening efforts and shift its focus to addressing the diminishing green spaces in the city’s urban area to mitigate rising temperatures and urban heat island (UHI) effects. </p>



<p>The city government emphasized the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/emissions-ndcs-fossil-fuel-production-adaptation-climate-change-united-nations-reports-2023/"">need to deal with the diminishing green spaces</a> in urban areas by planting more trees within the center. </p>



<p>Scientists associate rising temperatures with UHI which occurs when cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement and buildings that retain heat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unregulated conversion of green spaces like forests, grasslands, and parks to residential subdivisions causes increasingly high temperatures in the cities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Puerto Princesa officials reiterated their commitment to aggressively pursue an Urban Forestry Program with a specific emphasis on the re-greening of schools and open spaces within urban centers.</p>



<p>City Environment and Natural Resources Officer Carlo Gomez said planting more trees in the city sets a good example that citizens can emulate and demonstrates a new way of addressing climate change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said the students suffer from heat since many classrooms are not air-conditioned. Planting trees and providing shade helps bring down the temperature on their campuses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said they have included schools in the city’s greening efforts to help counter the UHI effect and mitigate climate change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on his observations, most areas within the city that register high temperatures are housing subdivisions with limited trees or vegetation.</p>



<p>Since 1991, Puerto Princesa City holds its biggest annual tree planting event every last Saturday of June each year during the Feast of the Forest, also known as <em>Pista Y Ang Cagueban</em> (PYAC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The is actively participated by various sectors, including the government, civil society, academe, religious, youth and students, and barangays, among others, and traditionally held in watershed and upland areas. Since 2023, they shifted their focus to the urban areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on official records of the City Environment and Natural Resources Office, groups participating in the PYAC have so far planted 2.6 million trees from 1991 to 2022 in 16 sites within the city’s upland barangays. Of the total trees planted, roughly 70% to 80% is estimated to have grown.</p>



<p>Gomez, a lawyer, said one of the crucial local policies that help in greening the city’s urban areas is the proposed landscape ordinance that will require builders, contractors, or developers to plant trees in their open spaces.</p>



<p>“This will provide mandate and compulsory compliance to land developers like Camella, Santa Lucia or Robinsons. As of now, there is no local ordinance that requires them to plant trees,” he said.</p>



<p>He said they are also pushing for the creation of a city housing council to address urban heat issues to improve the housing designs for city socialized housing beneficiaries. He said they want to require each lot owner to plant at least one tree within every 150-square meter of property.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Isa sa mga e address sa Urban Forestry Program titingnan yung environmental health ng ating mga (city housing) recipients kasi kung papansinin mo sa liit ng area nila, sila ang nag register ng matataas na urban heat. Kawawa</em>,” Gomez said.</p>



<p>(One of the areas that the Urban Forestry Program aims to address is the environmental health of the city housing recipients because as we have observed them, with their limited area, they register the hottest. Pitiful.)</p>



<p>He said a council that would look into urban heat issues would help improve the conditions of the beneficiaries and ensure that each housing unit has at least one tree that would benefit them and the people in the community.</p>

2611508,laureana-ka-luring-franco-cause-for-sainthood,"Will Ka Luring Franco, a Taguig catechist, be the next Filipino saint?","
<p>MANILA, Philippines – In 1969, Laureana “Ka Luring” Franco did the unthinkable: quit her government job to become a full-time catechist without a salary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They thought I was crazy to give up a well-paying and secure job back in the ‘60s and spend all my separation pay to enroll for a catechist’s training course,” Franco <a href=""https://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=%2F1995%2F05%2F23%2Flay-woman-is-unpaid-volunteer-catechist-for-life&amp;post_id=47347&amp;fbclid=IwAR3CAPNMo2QRjUf303wC2y-xDrIx8S1v6Nok8oSayRBG0cM7ZyIQxOrEgMI#"">said in a feature by Catholic news outlet UCAN</a> in 1995. “They couldn’t understand it when I explained I was happiest teaching catechism to children.”</p>



<p>After leaving her job as telephone switchboard operator and accounting clerk at the Philippine Air Force, Franco became known for her work as catechist – a teacher of the faith – in Taguig. She also became the first female lay minister of the Archdiocese of Manila, which covered Taguig before the city became part of the Diocese of Pasig in 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1990, Franco received one of the highest papal honors, the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice award, for her work as catechist, upon the recommendation of Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin and the approval of Pope John Paul II. In 2002 came another honor for Franco – the Mother Teresa Award – named in honor of a famous nun, now a saint, who served the poor in India.</p>



<p>Born to a poor family in Hagonoy, Taguig City, Franco <a href=""https://www.veritasph.net/cause-of-beatification-and-canonization-ng-katekistang-si-ka-luring-inilunsad-ng-diocese-of-pasig/"">died of cancer</a> at the age of 75 on October 17, 2011.</p>



<p>Now, the Diocese of Pasig aims to give Franco the highest of honors – elevation to the Catholic Church’s roster of saints – by pushing that she be beatified (or declared a “blessed,” one major step away from sainthood) and later canonized (or included in the Catholic Church’s “canon” of exemplary Catholics believed to be now in heaven).</p>

<p>“With this circular letter, I invite all the People of God in the Diocese of Pasig to participate in the tedious process of bringing to light the life and heroic virtues of a legendary catechist to sainthood,” wrote Pasig Bishop Mylo Hubert Vergara in a directive dated Thursday, February 22.</p>



<p>The directive came with a separate document, called an edict, also dated February 22.</p>



<p>“With the publication of the edict, herewith attached, is the start of the process as required by the Dicastery for the Causes of the Saints,” said Vergara, referring to the Vatican department in charge of screening candidates for sainthood.</p>

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Holiness in daily life&nbsp;</strong></h5>



<p>The push for Franco’s beatification and canonization is part of a bigger effort by the Catholic Church to introduce modern-day saints for the 21st century. One of the new candidates for sainthood in the Philippines is <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/diocese-laoag-opens-cause-sainthood-ilocano-girl-nina-ruiz-abad/"">Niña Ruiz Abad</a>, a 13-year-old girl from Sarrat, Ilocos Norte, who died of an incurable heart disease in 1993.</p>



<p>Sainthood is a tedious, expensive, and at times political process within the Vatican bureaucracy, and it takes years or even decades to declare a person a saint – a model of faith and an intercessor in heaven. Despite having had many sainthood candidates, the Philippines has only had two saints so far – Lorenzo Ruiz of Manila and Pedro Calungsod of Cebu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Father Bernie Carpio of the Diocese of Pasig, in a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/rcdioceseofpasig/videos/3649155091804114"">documentary on Franco’s life</a>, explained that Franco’s holiness can be seen in her day-to-day life. “<em>Sa simple’t ordinaryong buhay, isa lang ang pakay ni Ka Luring: ano ba ang kalooban ng Diyos </em>(In a simple and ordinary life, Ka Luring had one goal: what is the will of God)?” Carpio said.</p>



<p>The 1995 UCAN feature on Franco talked about her “greatest trial” at that time, when another religious group tried to recruit her – offering her an envelope containing $10,000 on her birthday – at a time when her mother “was dying of cancer and our bills were piling up for her treatment.”</p>



<p>Her recruiters said “that if Franco agreed to be their catechist, they would leave the money and provide her that same amount monthly to fund a catechetical program for them and to help finance her mother’s treatment,” UCAN reported.</p>



<p>Refusing this offer, Franco told them: “I can fool myself and I can fool you into believing I have changed my faith and give catechesis for you, just for the salary. But I can never fool God, he will know the truth.”</p>



<p>In the documentary posted by the Diocese of Pasig, Franco also spoke of the difficulties of being a catechist in Metro Manila, lamenting how distractions from media make it difficult to teach catechism even in private schools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Franco, however, emphasized the responsibility of parents in rearing their children. “<em>Ang magulang din dapat ang magpapaliwanag tungkol sa Panginoong Diyos</em> (Parents should also be the ones explaining about the Lord God),” Franco said. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>Now known as the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/lumad-teacher-booc-others-slain-davao-de-oro-military/"">New Bataan Massacre</a>,&nbsp;and despite calls for accountability over their deaths, justice remains elusive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But what has happened in the two years since their deaths?</p>



<p>When reports first came out of the killing,&nbsp;many groups denounced what had happened, particularly the persistent&nbsp;red-tagging&nbsp;of human rights activists and environmental defenders as well as the culture of impunity that had normalized such violence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These groups, which included Karapatan, IBON Foundation, Greenpeace, and the UP Cebu Student Council,&nbsp;as well as many individuals, demanded justice for the New Bataan 5, just a handful of the many victims of state-sponsored crackdown against dissenters.</p>



<p>Lumad&nbsp;schools have continued to be forcibly&nbsp;closed down, violating the rights of the&nbsp;Lumad&nbsp;children to an education that, according to the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,&nbsp;should be&nbsp;provided in their own languages, and in a manner appropriate to their cultural methods of learning and teaching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of these&nbsp;Lumad&nbsp;children have had to enroll in other schools or stop going to school completely, and others are still forcibly displaced from their homes.</p>

<p>Ironically, Chad Booc was our <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/anti-terror-law-petitioner-chad-booc-threatened-with-war-suits-teaching-indigenous-peoples-children/"">client in the petition we filed against the anti-terrow law</a>. As we argued in that petition we filed for indigenous and Moro peoples and those who worked with them, our clients were going to be targeted by the state because of their activism.</p>



<p>We were proven right.</p>



<p>The culture of impunity continues to pervade the lives of human rights and environmental defenders, especially leaders if indigenous peoples&nbsp;and those who work with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the Cordillera, indigenous rights activists, including Sarah&nbsp;Dekdeken, the secretary general of Cordillera Peoples’ Alliance (CPA), and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/luzon/baguio-court-hears-first-legal-challenge-against-terrorist-designation-december-14-2023/"">Windel&nbsp;Bolinget</a>, the Alliance’s Chairperson continue to be charged with cases claiming them to be terrorists.</p>



<p>&nbsp;In June 2023, the Anti-Terrorism Council&nbsp;(ATC)&nbsp;designated four leaders of the CPA, including&nbsp;Bolinget, asserting that they were leaders of the Communist Party of the Philippines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five months after their designation, the four CPA leaders challenged the ATC designation in court – calling the same arbitrary and unconstitutional, as well as injurious and constituting a violation of their rights. This challenge, which took place in the form of a petition for the issuance of the writs of certiorari, prohibition, and preliminary injunction against the ATC, was filed on the same day three activists (which included Hailey&nbsp;Pecayo, spokesperson of&nbsp;Tanggol&nbsp;Batanggan) secured a victory against two soldiers for trumped-up charges of violation of the Anti-Terror Law.</p>



<p>An anti-terror law complaint against Kenneth&nbsp;Rementilla&nbsp;and Jasmine Rubia, human rights advocates, was junked&nbsp;in November 2023; in addition, environmental activists&nbsp;Jonila&nbsp;Castro and&nbsp;Jhed&nbsp;Tamano were&nbsp;granted a temporary protection order as well as writs of&nbsp;amparo&nbsp;and&nbsp;habeas<em>&nbsp;</em>by the Supreme Court&nbsp;en banc, although arrest warrants were also issued against them for perjury.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-elusive-justice"">Elusive justice</h5>



<p>Despite this, many human rights activists and indigenous peoples&nbsp;still face constant threats, harassment, intimidation, and other kinds of violence for speaking up against&nbsp;oppressive government policies, and the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) continues its practice of red-tagging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yes, teachers Chad and&nbsp;Jurain&nbsp;and the rest of their group have yet to access the justice they so deserve, as no one has been held accountable yet for their killing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We owe it to teachers Chad and&nbsp;Jurain, to their students, to the communities they work with, and to the world they envisioned is possible and the legacy they left behind to keep fighting.&nbsp;We need to work on ensuring that justice is afforded to everyone, and that we create a safer world for all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teachers Chad and&nbsp;Jurain&nbsp;may no longer be with us physically, but their work lives on in&nbsp;each and every single one of us.

2608519,opinion-edsa-pwera-charter-change-waning-of-philippine-constitution,[OPINION] &#8216;Edsa-Pwera&#8217; and the waning of a Constitution,"
<p><em>“Panahon na para itama and hindi patas na Konstitusyon.” </em>That’s the battle cry of the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/charter-change-television-ad-airs-primetime-evening-newscast/"">commercial</a> that heralded the latest version of <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/193718-charter-change-explainer-philippine-constitution/"">charter change</a>. Yes, it tells the public that there’s inequality because the Constitution is itself unequal. And yes, it completely ignores that the Constitution has an “equal protection” clause. But those behind the ad don’t care. They just need to inflame the public. Social media scans show there’s a slew of accounts running the same narrative against the Constitution, and of course <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/people-power-philippines-world-bright-spot-1986/"">EDSA</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a potent strategy. The error of past Cha-Chas was that they were too cerebral. This one doesn’t make the same mistake. Of course, it incorporates economic thinking like, “We need to change it (the Constitution) because it has failed.” The reason? Because “35 years after the 1987 Constitution, nearly 80% consider themselves poor or near poor,” “our economy has fallen behind”, and “education has deteriorated”. Yes, it’s all non-sequitur but, what matters is that it triggers outrage. Troll farms need fuel.</p>



<p>So far, public reaction is muted. This favors the proponents and should alarm those against. It indicates that the combo of disinformation, economic punditry, and a huge war chest can’t be stopped by the same strategies that defeated Cha-Chas of the past. Calls to defend EDSA, the status quo, and the sanctity of the Constitution lack the power they once had.

<p>There’s a limit to the public’s patience. After 37 years, they have a right to resist calls for empty veneration. The Cha-Cha ad promises to uplift the ordinary Filipino. Who can say no to that?

<p>These are the “wedges” that disinformation operators are exploiting. They did it to win elections. Now they’re using it to fuel “Edsa-pwera.” Surviving this firehose of disinformation also requires keeping things digestible. Changing the Constitution is a national conversation, not a lecture. Arguments will be more effective if they leverage shared experience, or suffering. Fortunately, as to the latter, the middle-class and MSMEs have more in common with the masa than dynasties. We commute for hours and can’t afford to live near our workplaces because of high property prices. Now we’re told opening land ownership to foreigners will help?</p>



<p>Most important of all, against disinformation, we must realign with the people we claim to fight for.

<p>This constitutional moment is a reckoning. But it doesn’t have to be one-sided. With humility and a genuine commitment to put the common Filipino first, manufactured hate can be shifted towards the proper targets. If this Constitution is to be changed, then so be it. But, not by tactics fueled by disinformation and manufactured hate. Still, the Resistance, if it is to be effective, must be willing to give the public what it has been denied since 1987.

That's the battle cry of the  commercial  that heralded the latest version of  charter change . Yes, it tells the public that there's inequality because the Constitution is itself unequal. And yes, it completely ignores that the Constitution has an ""equal protection"" clause. But those behind the ad don't care. They just need to inflame the public. Social media scans show there's a slew of accounts running the same narrative against the Constitution, and of course  EDSA .      It's a potent strategy. The error of past Cha-Chas was that they were too cerebral. This one doesn't make the same mistake. Of course, it incorporates economic thinking like, ""We need to change it (the Constitution) because it has failed."" The reason? Because ""35 years after the 1987 Constitution, nearly 80% consider themselves poor or near poor,"" ""our economy has fallen behind"", and ""education has deteriorated"". Yes, it's all non-sequitur but, what matters is that it triggers outrage. Troll farms need fuel.      So far, public reaction is muted. This favors the proponents and should alarm those against. It indicates that the combo of disinformation, economic punditry, and a huge war chest can't be stopped by the same strategies that defeated Cha-Chas of the past. Calls to defend EDSA, the status quo, and the sanctity of the Constitution lack the power they once had.

2609368,military-launches-airstrike-fierce-clashes-inegros-occidental-february-22-2024,Military launches airstrike after fierce clashes in Negros Occidental,"
<p>NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – The military launched an airstrike on Thursday, February 22, in Sitio Mansulao, Barangay Pinapugusan, Escalante City, following sporadic armed clashes between state forces and a suspected band of New People&#8217;s Army (NPA) members.</p>



<p>At least 300 people were evacuated to safer grounds before the airstrike, and they were given appropriate assistance by the City Social Development Office (CSWDO), the military said on Friday, February 23.</p>



<p>Escalante City Mayor Beboy Yap declared a suspension of classes on Friday in eight villages in the northern city of Negros Occidental, including schools in Libertad, Pinapugasan, Binaguiohan, Paitan, Dian-ay, Magsaysay, Malasibog, and Tamlang.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the group Human Rights Advocates Negros (HRAN) condemned the military airstrike, resulting in evacuations and class cancellations, citing Geneva Convention protocols.</p>



<p>&#8220;Under Protocol 2 of the Geneva Convention, indiscriminate attacks are prohibited for failing to distinguish combatants and civilians alike,&#8221; a portion of the group’s statement read.</p>



<p>Lieutenant Colonel J-Jay Javines, 3rd Infantry Division public information office chief, told Rappler that the airstrike was launched by the military at around 7 pm on Thursday, to finish off members of the NPA&#8217;s Northern Negros Front (NNF), allegedly harassing and demanding food from villagers in the area.</p>



<p>A series of encounters started around 11 am on Wednesday, February 21, in the same village, resulting in the deaths of three suspected rebels and the wounding of three operating troops of the 79th Infantry Battalion and one Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU) member.</p>



<p>The military only identified the three rebel fatalities – two males and a female – as Michael, Jose, and Jandy, said to be aliases.</p>



<p>Javines said they were alarmed when villagers informed them of the presence of at least eight NPA rebels demanding food in the area, prompting them to conduct security patrols.</p>



<p>The military found high-powered firearms, one handgun, anti-personnel mines, mobile phones, personal belongings, and NPA documents from the first encounter site.</p>



<p>Javines said the band of rebels in the area was likely protecting a high-ranking guerilla who allegedly came into the area to strengthen the NNF, one of the guerrilla fronts in Negros that state forces had declared to have dismantled in 2021.</p>



<p>Javines said the military did not violate any law, and they conducted risk assessments before the airstrike, including mapping out farms and evacuating community members.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even without the airstrike, people will tend to vacate their abode because if their residences are just adjacent to the encounter site, it&#8217;s better to ensure their safety,&#8221; Javines said.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-denial-and-claims"">Denial and claims</h5>



<p>NPA&#8217;s Apolinario Gatmaitan Command-Negros Island spokesperson Ka Maoche Legislador denied the military&#8217;s claim that there were eight armed encounters before the airstrike.</p>



<p>Legislador said that among all the encounters, only Wednesday&#8217;s armed engagement was legitimate along the border of communities of Barangay San Isidro in Toboso town and Barangay Mansulao of Escalante City.</p>



<p>&#8220;As clarified by the RJPC-NPA (Roselyn Jean Pelle Command), there was no firefight in the area yesterday morning. Instead, over 10 bombs were dropped on Sitio Mansulao, part of Escalante City, between 6 to 9 in the morning, damaging livelihoods and the environment,&#8221; he said. – <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

Lieutenant Colonel J-Jay Javines, 3rd Infantry Division public information office chief, told Rappler that the airstrike was launched by the military at around 7 pm on Thursday, to finish off members of the NPA's Northern Negros Front (NNF), allegedly harassing and demanding food from villagers in the area.      A series of encounters started around 11 am on Wednesday, February 21, in the same village, resulting in the deaths of three suspected rebels and the wounding of three operating troops of the 79th Infantry Battalion and one Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU) member.      The military only identified the three rebel fatalities - two males and a female - as Michael, Jose, and Jandy, said to be aliases.      Javines said they were alarmed when villagers informed them of the presence of at least eight NPA rebels demanding food in the area, prompting them to conduct security patrols.      The military found high-powered firearms, one handgun, anti-personnel mines, mobile phones, personal belongings, and NPA documents from the first encounter site.      Javines said the band of rebels in the area was likely protecting a high-ranking guerilla who allegedly came into the area to strengthen the NNF, one of the guerrilla fronts in Negros that state forces had declared to have dismantled in 2021.      Javines said the military did not violate any law, and they conducted risk assessments before the airstrike, including mapping out farms and evacuating community members.      ""Even without the airstrike, people will tend to vacate their abode because if their residences are just adjacent to the encounter site, it's better to ensure their safety,"" Javines said.      Denial and claims      NPA's Apolinario Gatmaitan Command-Negros Island spokesperson Ka Maoche Legislador denied the military's claim that there were eight armed encounters before the airstrike.      Legislador said that among all the encounters, only Wednesday's armed engagement was legitimate along the border of communities of Barangay San Isidro in Toboso town and Barangay Mansulao of Escalante City.      ""As clarified by the RJPC-NPA (Roselyn Jean Pelle Command), there was no firefight in the area yesterday morning. Instead, over 10 bombs were dropped on Sitio Mansulao, part of Escalante City, between 6 to 9 in the morning, damaging livelihoods and the environment,"" he said. -  Rappler.com   ",Negative

2609209,student-leaders-extend-causes-beyond-campus-borders,Student leaders: Extend causes beyond campus borders,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – During a recent gathering of almost a hundred youth leaders and campus journalists at the Rappler office, students agreed they should organize into alliances to create awareness about key issues beyond their respective campuses.</p>



<p>During a panel discussion on Saturday, February 17, in Move PH’s “<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/moveph/by-the-youth-for-the-youth-rappler-event-highlight-student-actions-february-17-2024/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">By the youth, for the youth</a>” on-ground event, Explained PH editor-in-chief Archie Bergosa stressed the importance of consistently organizing students to bring their causes outside their usual communities. </p>



<p>For example, the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/environment/ateneans-reject-tree-cutting-north-carpark-renovation-project/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">battle</a>&nbsp;against the cutting of 83 trees in the North Carpark of Ateneo de Manila University also jibed with similar, if not the same, issues beyond the campus – transport and climate crises – thus making the extension of the cause crucial.</p>



<p>For Bergosa, it’s important for students to foster a sense of community among stakeholders because doing so will create allies among those who support the same advocacies.</p>



<p>Blue Mobility president and co-founder Maxine Cuartero said it is important to acknowledge both differences and similarities in mindsets between parties involved – especially between the youth and administration officials – and find opportunities to organize both communities effectively.</p>



<p>University of the Philippines (UP) student regent Sofia Jan Trinidad said during the panel discussion that challenges inside campuses can only be addressed by consultations with students themselves. They will only get to understand pressing issues in their communities if student councils present their campaigns to the student community. </p>



<p>Trinidad, who was also one of the mobilizers for the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/ways-help-palestinian-refugees-temporarily-housed-up-diliman/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">housing of Palestinian refugees</a> in their campus, said that push back against anti-student policies by the university administration is important, too. </p>



<p>Students, she said, must insist on asserting their space on campus. “<em>Hindi kami nag-a-adjust. We assert our space in the university and this should also be a practice sa atin na in-a-assert natin&nbsp;‘yung sarili natin sa society, kung saan tayo nakatira,&nbsp;kasi kabataan tayo, they put prime sa atin bilang youth, [bilang] mga kabataan na pag-asa tayo ng bayan, pero bakit parang wala silang tiwala sa kakayahan natin or ni-li-limit nila ‘yung kaya nating gawin</em>,” said Trinidad.</p>

We assert our space in the university and this should also be a practice among us that&nbsp;we assert ourselves in society, or wherever we live,&nbsp;because we are the youth, they put [primary importance to] us as the country&#8217;s future, but why does it seem like they don’t trust our capabilities or limit what we can do?)</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-growing-democratic-spaces"">Growing democratic spaces</h5>



<p>Heather Andres, a development studies student, highlighted three “baby steps” that could help grow democratic campus spaces for students: consistent student clamor, maximized communication with the administration, and genuine organization of the student body.</p>



<p>“We’re not backing down from what you&#8217;re telling us,” she said, referring to university administrations. Being the school’s biggest stakeholders, she said that students must not let their concerns be set aside in academic spaces. University boards should hear students who want to uphold their welfare.</p>



<p>Marcuz Red Tevez from the National Teachers College also shared the importance of the government&#8217;s reallocation and prioritization of the budget for education. An insufficient budget allocated to education institutions is the root cause of all problems in the sector, he said.</p>



<p>A sufficient budget for schools and universities, he said, will provide wider educational access to students from remote provinces. He emphasized that it will not only improve facilities and quality education to schools, but also provide higher wages for teachers and professors.</p>



<p>Last week, students from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/metro-manila/students-protest-bills-polytechnic-univerisity-philippines-privatization/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">protested</a> against looming commercialization of campus services after House committee on higher and technical chairperson Representative Mark Go said that state universities should not always rely on the national government for their budgets. </p>



<p>During the deliberation on the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/242008-opinion-pup-national-university-bill/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">National Polytechnic University bills</a>, he argued that income-generating projects must be done by these universities to help the state address budget issues.</p>

2609062,in-this-economy-small-wins-matter-fight-against-martial-law-denialism,[In This Economy] Small wins matter in the fight against Martial Law denialism,"
<p class=""has-drop-cap"">Almost two years into the Marcos Jr. administration, there are continuing efforts to whitewash the Martial Law dictatorship (1972-1986) and, at the same time, downplay the importance of the EDSA People Power Revolution (February 22-25, 1986).</p>



<p>For instance, in September 2023, the Department of Education <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/educators-slam-deped-plan-change-diktadurang-marcos-new-curriculum/"">dropped</a> the term “diktadurang Marcos” (Marcos dictatorship) and instead just put “diktadura” in the new MATATAG basic education curriculum.</p>



<p>On the face of it, this seems an innocuous edit. But it’s particularly pernicious because it’s a form of <em>institutionalized</em> whitewashing. Teachers all over the nation will have to use this whitewashed term.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, In February 2024, PHLPost <a href=""https://phlpost.gov.ph/cpt-press-releases/phlpost-presented-personalized-stamps-to-100-year-old-enrile/"">created</a> commemorative stamps to mark the hundredth birthday of Juan Ponce Enrile, Marcos Sr.’s former defense minister.</p>



<p>Said Postmaster General Luis Carlos, “Living to 100 years old is one of life’s greatest achievements, and definitely a milestone worth celebrating. We pay tribute to JPE whose&nbsp;political career has spanned over six decades…. His collective wisdom and experience is an inspiration to us all.”</p>



<p>But should we glorify the man whose fake ambush was used to justify the declaration of Martial Law on September 23, 1972, and who later became a top crony who profited immensely from various logging concessions that accelerated deforestation?</p>



<p>And then, of course, in October 2023, President Marcos Jr. <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/preparations-commemoration-edsa-revolution-february-2024/"">excluded</a> February 25, 2024 as a public holiday that’s supposed to mark the 38<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the EDSA People Power Revolution. We knew something like this would happen when Marcos won the presidency in May 2022.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-survey-says"">Survey says</h5>



<p>Data can shed light on why it’s so easy for the regime to glorify Martial Law and downplay People Power.</p>



<p>The graph below summarizes findings in a <a href=""https://www.sws.org.ph/downloads/publications/pr20230927%20-%20Sep%2027%202023%20Kapihan%20sa%20SWS_They%20Never%20Left.pdf"">new paper</a> titled, “They Never Left: Popular Impressions of Ferdinand E. Marcos as President After February 1986.” This was authored by SWS fellows Jorge Tigno, Geoffrey Ducanes, Steven Rood, and Vladymir Joseph Licudine, and published in September 2023.</p>



<p>In at least four surveys starting in 1986, SWS was able to conduct polls asking Filipinos about their sentiments about Ferdinand Marcos Sr. Interestingly, just a few years after EDSA, Filipinos’ perceptions of Marcos Sr. significantly and undeniably became more positive.</p>



<p>For the claim that Marcos Sr. was “caring for friends who enriched themselves by pocketing government funds,” 70% agreed in 1986, but only 50% agreed in 1995, just nine years later. That’s a statistically significant drop.</p>



<p>As for the statement that Marcos Sr. was a “severe, brutal or oppressive president,” 45% agreed in 1986 (not even a majority), and only 39% agreed in 1995.</p>



<p>On the flip side of the coin, too many people placed Marcos Sr. in a positive light too quickly.</p>



<p>In 1986, 39% agreed that Marcos Sr. was a “defender of the poor and oppressed”, and 42% agreed that he was “true to the duties of a patriotic president.” In 1995, 55% and 57% (more than half) agreed with these statements, respectively.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2022, a lot more people agreed that Marcos Sr. was “good,” while much fewer agreed that he was “bad.” This may be because the SWS survey was done in June 2022, when Marcos Jr. had already won the presidency.</p>



<p>But at the same time, the proliferation of disinformation and influencer campaigns between 2016 and 2022, as well as the poor teaching of Philippine history over many decades, may also have contributed to this lamentable outcome.</p>



<p>On top of everything, the Marcos Jr. administration is actively, if not aggressively, triggering authoritarian nostalgia by reviving many policies of Marcos Sr.</p>



<p>Examples include the Kadiwa stores, Masagana 99, the “golden age of infrastructure,” Maharlika Investment Fund, and Bagong Pilipinas (obviously a callback to Marcos Sr.’s Bagong Lipunan).</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-fighting-back"">Fighting back</h5>



<p>The task before historians and educators these days is tougher than ever. Everything is stacked against those who want to spread facts and truths about Martial Law and EDSA.</p>



<p>But…not exactly everything. Here and there, there are pockets of resistance offering glimpses of hope.</p>



<p>For one, more and more academics are pushing back by writing new books and articles about the Martial Law dictatorship. These include <a href=""https://diktadura.upd.edu.ph/2022/09/21/marcos-lies/""><em>Marcos Lies</em></a> (by researchers of the UP Third World Studies Center), <a href=""https://www.ateneo.edu/news/2022/10/20/new-press-marcos-era-reader""><em>The Marcos Era: A Reader</em></a> (edited by Leia Castañeda Anastaco and Jojo Abinales), and my very own <a href=""https://www.ateneo.edu/news/2023/02/26/new-press-false-nostalgia-marcos-golden-age-myths-how-debunk-them""><em>False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them</em></a> (published by Ateneo University Press).</p>



<p>I’m happy to share that in the first year since it was published, <em>False Nostalgia</em> has had four print runs already, and is constantly out of stock in online shops. But I’m most elated by the fact that public school teachers are sending me photos of them using the book as a reference in their Araling Panlipunan (Social Studies) classes. A small win, but it’s nothing short of elating. And I hope many more teachers and students get to use the book.</p>



<p>But just like what I <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/analysis-undoing-false-nostalgia-marcos-dictatorship/"">said</a> last year, books won’t be nearly enough. We need to create and amplify content on social media platforms where most Gen Zs get their information.</p>



<p>We also need to do more of these discussions in person. It’s one thing to like and share each other’s social media posts or attend talks in Zoom, another if we get to converse with one another, face-to-face.</p>



<p>Here, I try to do my fair share. In 2023, I brought <em>False Nostalgia</em> to 14 talks all over the country, including Los Baños, Iloilo, Bacolod, Baguio, Naga, and Metro Manila of course. Just yesterday, I came from Palawan State University, which hosted a whole-day series of talks on various aspects of Martial Law and the EDSA commemoration.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not always easy to organize talks and fora on Martial Law issues, because in many cases such discussions are being actively repressed by education authorities who try to toe the administration’s line. That is why schools and student orgs and NGOs that actually get to do these talks are to be commended for their bravery and commitment to the truth.</p>



<p>Interestingly, most of my book talks over the past year were hosted by <em>private</em> schools and universities which are not beholden to education officialdom. In a recent talk at Assumption College, for example, I was heartened by the fact that senior high school students taking up Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) converted their classrooms into museum exhibits about various aspects of Martial Law, and these exhibits were toured by their non-HUMSS peers. What a creative and fun way for students to engage!</p>



<p>I’m come to realize over the past year that if we are to make any headway, we need to embed and institutionalize the teaching of Martial Law history in curricula. But I hope this can be done by the Department of Education most of all. At the same time, I hope they can also permanently include online literacy and fact-checking in the new basic education curriculum.</p>



<p>At the higher education level, Martial Law must be a required subject just like the Life and Works of Rizal.</p>



<p>In coming years, expect even more efforts on the part of the Marcoses and their friends to lionize the Marcoses and erase any hint of the dictatorship’s gross abuses and corruption. But I also hope we can boost the resistance and rope in as many people as possible.</p>

For instance, in September 2023, the Department of Education  dropped  the term ""diktadurang Marcos"" (Marcos dictatorship) and instead just put ""diktadura"" in the new MATATAG basic education curriculum.      On the face of it, this seems an innocuous edit. But it's particularly pernicious because it's a form of  institutionalized  whitewashing. Teachers all over the nation will have to use this whitewashed term.      Meanwhile, In February 2024, PHLPost  created  commemorative stamps to mark the hundredth birthday of Juan Ponce Enrile, Marcos Sr.'s former defense minister.      Said Postmaster General Luis Carlos, ""Living to 100 years old is one of life's greatest achievements, and definitely a milestone worth celebrating. We pay tribute to JPE whose political career has spanned over six decades.... His collective wisdom and experience is an inspiration to us all.""      But should we glorify the man whose fake ambush was used to justify the declaration of Martial Law on September 23, 1972, and who later became a top crony who profited immensely from various logging concessions that accelerated deforestation?      And then, of course, in October 2023, President Marcos Jr.  excluded  February 25, 2024 as a public holiday that's supposed to mark the 38 th  Anniversary of the EDSA People Power Revolution. We knew something like this would happen when Marcos won the presidency in May 2022.      Survey says      Data can shed light on why it's so easy for the regime to glorify Martial Law and downplay People Power.      The graph below summarizes findings in a  new paper  titled, ""They Never Left: Popular Impressions of Ferdinand E. Marcos as President After February 1986."" This was authored by SWS fellows Jorge Tigno, Geoffrey Ducanes, Steven Rood, and Vladymir Joseph Licudine, and published in September 2023.      In at least four surveys starting in 1986, SWS was able to conduct polls asking Filipinos about their sentiments about Ferdinand Marcos Sr. Interestingly, just a few years after EDSA, Filipinos' perceptions of Marcos Sr. significantly and undeniably became more positive.      For the claim that Marcos Sr. was ""caring for friends who enriched themselves by pocketing government funds,"" 70% agreed in 1986, but only 50% agreed in 1995, just nine years later. That's a statistically significant drop.      As for the statement that Marcos Sr. was a ""severe, brutal or oppressive president,"" 45% agreed in 1986 (not even a majority), and only 39% agreed in 1995.      On the flip side of the coin, too many people placed Marcos Sr. in a positive light too quickly.      In 1986, 39% agreed that Marcos Sr. was a ""defender of the poor and oppressed"", and 42% agreed that he was ""true to the duties of a patriotic president.""

2608480,university-santo-tomas-student-receives-show-cause-letter-administration-february-2024,Thomasian student activist receives show-cause letter from UST administration,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – With the censorship controversy at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) still simmering, a student activist who led on Monday, February 19, a protest which urged Thomasians to <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/newsletters/university-santo-tomas-photo-takedown-press-freedom/"">help defend campus press freedom</a>  received a &#8220;show cause notice&#8221; from the school for allegedly violating UST&#8217;s Code of Conduct.</p>



<p>In particular, UST&#8217;s Office for Student Affairs (OSA) called out Raven Racelis, a philosophy student at the university, for being the chairperson of the organization Panday Sining UST. </p>



<p>She was told to explain in writing why she should not be disciplined for her infraction.</p>



<p>Racelis said in a statement that the UST-OSA notice alleged that she violated the Code of Conduct  which states that students “shall join or form only student organizations whose objectives uphold the vision and mission of the University,” and that they shall not use the schools name or logo in any activity “unless duly authorized by the Office of the Secretary General.”</p>



<p>Racelis added that the UST-OSA based its notice on a September 6, 2023 social media post &#8220;showing that you are the Chairperson of the said organization.&#8221;</p>



<p>Panday Sining, a national demographic mass organization, describes itself as a &#8220;national performing group of artists aiming to create art as a medium for progressive expressions of national democracy.&#8221;</p>



<p>“To be targeted by the UST admin is a brand of progressiveness — proof that I spoke out against the student repression in UST, rebelled against state fascism, and stood with the basic sectors in the fight for national democracy,” said Racelis in a statement.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the university took heavy flak for forcing TomasinoWeb, its student-led digital media organization, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/censorship-tomasinoweb-university-santo-tomas-photo-takedown/"">to take down a now-viral photo of some of its students entering a convenience store</a>. UST said the social post was a “source of public ridicule.”</p>



<p>The picture was a part of a social media post featuring students from different colleges wearing their “Type B” uniforms, which are typically worn during the first half of the year.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Handa ako at hindi ako natatakot dahil alam naman natin na between [the university] and me, sila ang mali dito. Nasa likod ko ang mga Tomasino na biktima rin ng pagiging represibo nito</em>,&#8221; Racelis told Rappler in an interview, adding that she is currently drafting a response to university officials with the help of her legal team.</p>



<p>The national office of Panday Sining expressed its support for Racelis and slammed UST for being “desperate in maintaining the rotting education system which is repressive in nature.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If the mission of UST is to dedicate itself to the generation, advancement, integration, dissemination, and application of knowledge to form competent and compassionate persons committed to serve the Church, the nation, and the global community, then it is clear that the administration of UST itself is failing,” it said in a statement.</p>

2607912,university-santo-tomas-photo-takedown-press-freedom,How the UST photo takedown got us talking about press freedom,"
<p>“Assert our space.”</p>



<p>These words are from University of the Philippines Student Regent Sofia Jan Trinidad while she was at the Rappler newsroom last Saturday, February 17.</p>



<p>Her words rang again in my ears just two days later when news broke that the University of Santo Tomas school administration pressured its students’ digital media organization TomasinoWeb to <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/censorship-tomasinoweb-university-santo-tomas-photo-takedown/"">take down a photo</a> it had posted on social media.</p>



<p>Innocuous perhaps to most, this photo merely showed students of UST’s College of Information and Computing Sciences standing in front of a 7-Eleven store. Intentionally or not, the photo does make one notice how the students’ uniforms mirror the colors of the convenience store brand. According to UST, this brought “public ridicule” upon the institution, warranting a takedown of the photo.</p>



<p>Leo Laparan II, a journalist who serves as TomasinoWeb’s publications adviser, resigned in protest, calling the school authority’s act a “clear illustration of censorship.”</p>



<p>Now according to UST’s rules, because TomasinoWeb has lost its publications adviser, it cannot be allowed to make any new social media posts until Laparan is replaced. Apparently, because TomasinoWeb is not “officially” a student publication under UST rules, it needs an adviser to keep posting on social media. Never mind that the Campus Journalism Act of 1991 states that student publications in universities aren’t required to have such an adviser. The law defines student publications as, “The issue of any printed material that is independently published by, and which meets the needs and interests of, the studentry.” Its Section 4 also carries this definition: “A student publication is published by the student body through an editorial board and publication staff composed of students selected by fair and competitive examinations.”</p>



<p>Let’s go back to Sofia.</p>



<p>She was one of the speakers at our <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/moveph/by-the-youth-for-the-youth-rappler-event-highlight-student-actions-february-17-2024/"">“By the Youth, For the Youth” event</a> organized by our civic engagement arm, MovePH. Around 100 student leaders, campus journalists, and youth organization members showed up at our newsroom to talk about how they can make a difference in public issues they care about, within and beyond campus.</p>



<p>Sofia, one of the UP student leaders who mobilized during the Christmas holiday season to <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/ways-help-palestinian-refugees-temporarily-housed-up-diliman/"">provide shelter to Palestinian refugees</a>, said the UP student council often faces pressures from their school administration too.</p>



<p><em>“Hindi kami nag-a-adjust. We assert our space in the university and this should also be a practice sa atin na ina-assert natin ‘yung sarili natin sa society, kung saan tayo nakatira,”</em> she said during the panel discussion.</p>

These words are from University of the Philippines Student Regent Sofia Jan Trinidad while she was at the Rappler newsroom last Saturday, February 17.      Her words rang again in my ears just two days later when news broke that the University of Santo Tomas school administration pressured its students' digital media organization TomasinoWeb to  take down a photo  it had posted on social media.      Innocuous perhaps to most, this photo merely showed students of UST's College of Information and Computing Sciences standing in front of a 7-Eleven store. Intentionally or not, the photo does make one notice how the students' uniforms mirror the colors of the convenience store brand. According to UST, this brought ""public ridicule"" upon the institution, warranting a takedown of the photo.      Leo Laparan II, a journalist who serves as TomasinoWeb's publications adviser, resigned in protest, calling the school authority's act a ""clear illustration of censorship.""      Now according to UST's rules, because TomasinoWeb has lost its publications adviser, it cannot be allowed to make any new social media posts until Laparan is replaced. Apparently, because TomasinoWeb is not ""officially"" a student publication under UST rules, it needs an adviser to keep posting on social media. Never mind that the Campus Journalism Act of 1991 states that student publications in universities aren't required to have such an adviser. The law defines student publications as, ""The issue of any printed material that is independently published by, and which meets the needs and interests of, the studentry."" Its Section 4 also carries this definition: ""A student publication is published by the student body through an editorial board and publication staff composed of students selected by fair and competitive examinations.""      Let's go back to Sofia.      She was one of the speakers at our  ""By the Youth, For the Youth"" event  organized by our civic engagement arm, MovePH. Around 100 student leaders, campus journalists, and youth organization members showed up at our newsroom to talk about how they can make a difference in public issues they care about, within and beyond campus.      Sofia, one of the UP student leaders who mobilized during the Christmas holiday season to  provide shelter to Palestinian refugees , said the UP student council often faces pressures from their school administration too.       ""Hindi kami nag-a-adjust. We assert our space in the university and this should also be a practice sa atin na ina-assert natin 'yung sarili natin sa society, kung saan tayo nakatira,""  she said during the panel discussion.      (We don't adjust. We assert our space in the university and this should also be a practice among us, that we assert ourselves in society, or wherever we live.)

2607699,only-in-hollywood-will-paul-giamatti-latest-grumpy-role-lead-first-oscar-win,[Only IN Hollywood] Will Paul Giamatti’s latest grumpy role lead to his 1st Oscar win?,"
<p>LOS ANGELES, USA – “I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever work if I was like this. Nobody would want to employ me,” Paul Giamatti said about his grumpy prep school teacher in&nbsp;<em>The Holdovers</em>&nbsp;for which he is ranked, along with Cillian Murphy in&nbsp;<em>Oppenheimer</em>, as the top two contenders for the best actor Oscar come March 10.</p>



<p>Undoubtedly one of the best films of 2023,&nbsp;<em>The Holdovers</em>&nbsp;is also up for the Academy’s Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Da’Vine Joy Randolph, who is considered the frontrunner), Best Original Screenplay (David Hemingson), and Best Editing (Kevin Tent). Paul already won the Golden Globe Award, his third, for his performance in the melancholic yet engrossing film.</p>



<p>Set in the 1970s, the comedy-drama narrates what happens when Paul’s history instructor, Da’Vine’s grieving cook, and a troubled student (Dominic Sessa) are forced to remain on campus during Christmas break.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img decoding=""async"" loading=""lazy"" width=""460"" height=""808"" src=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/02/The-Holdovers-poster-art.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2607729"" srcset=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/02/The-Holdovers-poster-art.jpg?resize=460%2C808&amp;zoom=1 460w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/02/The-Holdovers-poster-art.jpg?resize=460%2C808&amp;zoom=0.5 230w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/02/The-Holdovers-poster-art.jpg?resize=460%2C808&amp;zoom=0.25 115w"" sizes=""(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"" /></figure>



<p>“I suppose, in a lot of ways, they say and do the things I would never do. I&#8217;m not like this (character), thank God,” Paul added about Paul Hunham, the latest of the curmudgeonly characters he has brought to life in film.</p>



<p>“They&#8217;re great characters to play. They&#8217;re complicated, interesting characters. And they&#8217;re often funny, which is good, too.”</p>



<p>While Paul has played his share of good-natured characters – from Joe Gould in&nbsp;<em>Cinderella Man</em>&nbsp;to Ralph in&nbsp;<em>Saving Mr. Banks</em>&nbsp;– he has also gifted us with memorable miscreants, villains, drunks, and plain acerbic guys.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s some weird way in which it allows me to act out on something,” the 56-year-old actor reflected in a virtual global press conference for&nbsp;<em>The Holdovers</em>. “It&#8217;s always a question to me of, do I seek these things out unconsciously? Do I attract them? Do I just bring something to these parts? I don&#8217;t know.”</p>



<p>“I do think that, especially with lead roles, somebody sees you do something and they want to see you do it again, and so that&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s great. They&#8217;re great parts. So, I got no complaints about that.”</p>



<p>To his supreme credit, Hunham and Paul’s other irascible characters – including Miles in&nbsp;<em>Sideways</em>, Jerry in&nbsp;<em>Straight Outta Compton</em>, Chief Inspector Walter Uhl in&nbsp;<em>The Illusionist</em>, and King John in&nbsp;<em>Ironclad</em>, to name a few – are always imbued by Paul with humanity and are never cardboard figures.</p>



<p>Asked if playing these crabby men is somehow his unconscious way of exorcising thoughts in the back of his mind, Paul replied, “Probably, yeah. I mean, maybe unconsciously. I&#8217;m not so aware of what it is I need to get rid of. But obviously, something about me needs to get some of this out of me.”</p>



<p>“And I used to play, and still do, a lot of rage and anger. I&#8217;m always like, am I this angry a person at some level that I need these things to get all this rage out sometimes? I don&#8217;t know, maybe so.”</p>



<p>“Because more and more in my own life, I do not feel like an angry, rageful person. So, it must be doing something for me.”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s hard to piss me off,” he declared. “You can but it&#8217;s not easy to piss me off. There are guys I play who are ready to be pissed off all the time. They sort of live in a state of like hair-trigger aggressive anger all the time.”</p>



<p>“You never know,” Paul answered on whether he felt his film reunion with director Alexander Payne after almost two decades since&nbsp;<em>Sideways</em>&nbsp;would create another critical and commercial access.</p>

<p>“I think because it&#8217;s Alexander, you sense that you&#8217;re doing something special, at least for each other, and that&#8217;s the important thing. You&#8217;re making something that you&#8217;re all in love with and you&#8217;re having a lovely time.”</p>



<p>“And you hope that it gets handed over and people feel the same way about it. So, whatever the experience is, it&#8217;s special with him. Then it&#8217;s lovely that people embrace it as much as they do.”</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s a lot of basic humanity in his movies,” Paul said about the filmmaker behind&nbsp;<em>About Schmidt</em>,&nbsp;<em>Election</em>,&nbsp;<em>Nebraska</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Descendants</em>.</p>



<p>“They&#8217;re real people and you can relate to them. The message of connection, empathy, sound family, care for each other, and all of those things, all of the warmth and intimacy of those ideas are exemplified in the movie.”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a nice thing to feel in a really profound way like that. The world is nutty right now, in so many ways. And to have something that&#8217;s about this simple drama of these three small people alone in this vast place, and they discover each other, is really beautiful.”</p>



<p>Paul was effusive about working with Alexander again. “The best working relationship I&#8217;ve ever had. I’m friends with him, too. We have a friendship that grew over the years, too.”</p>



<p>“He&#8217;s the best director I’ve ever worked with. I think he&#8217;s the best director around. It&#8217;s very fun, intimate and friendly. It&#8217;s like we just happen to be making a movie. We don&#8217;t talk a lot about it.”</p>



<p>“If an actor needs to talk a lot about stuff, he can do that but we don&#8217;t talk a lot about stuff. And it&#8217;s very simple things, simple direction, simple ideas. It&#8217;s all very simple. And it&#8217;s just fun.”</p>



<p>“As a director with actors, he was the same – just better,” Paul said about how Alexander has evolved since their 2004 collaboration. “It was like he was even more at ease. He likes actors, which is really great. And he likes connecting with them.”</p>



<p>As for any link between&nbsp;<em>Sideways</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Holdovers</em>, and between the eighth-grade English teacher and oenophile in the former and the Jim Beam-drinking Roman history instructor in the latter, Paul remarked, “It&#8217;s interesting – the whole relationship between the two movies.”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a funny subject that Alexander and I tiptoed around without really ever directly addressing it. It&#8217;s a good, in some ways a better question for him, how much he was thinking of the other movie.”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a similar guy 20 years on, who is sort of changed in certain ways. There&#8217;s a lot of similarities. There&#8217;s a lot of dialogue between the two of them. It&#8217;s very interesting.”</p>



<p>“I can only say that I found this character different. He&#8217;s a similar guy. I liked this character more. I think this guy&#8217;s got more backbone and he&#8217;s got more going on. He&#8217;s tougher than the other guy.”</p>



<p>“He&#8217;s not self-pitying the way the other guy is. There&#8217;s something I like about him more. Could the other guy have ended up this way? I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s different times.”</p>



<p>“I think the other guy, a 20-year change could be different because there&#8217;s psychotherapy and things like that. Then there are antidepressants and things.”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a very interesting question how the two movies relate. I think they do in a lot of ways but I would love to hear Alexander talk about it sometime.”</p>



<p>Reminded about the two characters’ shared fondness for alcohol, Paul agreed: “That&#8217;s true. They both have drinking issues. So does Da’Vine’s character, too. She has a little bit of an issue with drinking. And for different reasons.”</p>

<p>“It&#8217;s a fun thing to do,” Paul quipped about playing sloshed guys. “It&#8217;s an interesting thing to play, physically and emotionally. And everything about it is interesting. It&#8217;s like, you&#8217;re changed, and things change and the physical aspect of it is fun.”</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve done it a lot. I did it on stage a lot. When I did plays, I would frequently play the guy who drinks too much on stage and I&#8217;ve done it in other movies, too.”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not just Alexander&#8217;s (movies). I did a movie called&nbsp;<em>Barney&#8217;s Version</em>&nbsp;where I play a character worse than these two guys. It really blows his life apart by drinking too much.”</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t know why it comes to me but I definitely find it an interesting thing to play. It&#8217;s fun in its perverse way to play it.”</p>



<p>Paul told Backstage in a 2019 interview:&nbsp;“At drama school, if there was a drunk – especially a drunk old guy – I was absolutely a shoo-in for that part.”</p>



<p>But he clarified, “No, I can only say that I&#8217;m not a big drinker off-screen. Not that I haven&#8217;t been inebriated in my life. But I&#8217;m not a big drinker, no.”</p>



<p>The Hunham character is set apart from Paul’s previous portrayals because the teacher has a lazy eye, one of the reasons why the students mock him behind his back. Not only that – the professor suffers from trimethylaminuria, defined by NHS, UK’s popular website, as “an uncommon condition that causes an unpleasant, fishy smell. It’s also called ‘fish odor syndrome.’”</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, Paul is the type who would not mind being snowbound like his Hunham in&nbsp;<em>The Holdovers</em>. “Blessing to me,” he stressed. “It sounds fantastic to me. It sounds like heaven to me. Yeah, I would love it. I would have no problem with that.”</p>



<p>“I&#8217;d love nothing more than to be snowed in. I love nothing more than a blizzard and a snowstorm that shuts everything down.”</p>



<p>While it’s well-known that Paul went to prep schools and Yale in real life, earning his BA in 1989, not many people are aware that his late father, A. Bartlett Giamatti, an English Renaissance literature professor, went on to become president of Yale from 1978 to 1986, the youngest in the university’s history. His mom, Toni Marilyn Giamatti, is an English teacher.</p>



<p>Paul received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Yale in 2023. In awarding Paul an honorary degree, Yale also cited his work in television, including&nbsp;<em>John Adams</em>&nbsp;(title role),&nbsp;<em>Downton Abbey</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Billions</em>.</p>



<p>“Sure,” Paul quickly replied when asked if filming&nbsp;<em>The Holdovers</em>&nbsp;took him back to his prep school days “Again, probably unconsciously, I did a lot. Or days when I went to a prep school like that.”</p>



<p>But a scene outside the prep campus was his favorite – just watching Dominic skate which was a turning point in the teacher-student’s dynamics. “The thing I enjoyed the most was the whole day we shot around the skating rink and stuff like that. It was all a day at that place doing stuff.”</p>



<p>“I think it was the same day we shot the liquor store stuff but I really enjoyed shooting the ice skating stuff. Just watching him (Dominic’s Angus) ice skate was a thing in the script that I really liked and was a thing that I really loved shooting.”</p>

<p>“And no words or anything like that. It was just him (Hunham, his character) beginning to see the kid (Angus) in a different way and the kid beginning to see him in a different way. There&#8217;s something really lovely about that scene.”</p>



<p>Recalling his student days, Paul shared memories of having a teacher who reminded him a bit of his Hunham character. “There was a teacher. I wouldn&#8217;t call him a mentor but those schools are rough and the teachers are rough.”</p>



<p>“He was one of the only teachers who wasn&#8217;t like that. I don&#8217;t want to call him a mentor but he was a nice guy.”</p>



<p>“If I was interested in the subject, I was good. If I wasn&#8217;t interested, I didn&#8217;t work very hard.”</p>



<p>“I was hopeless in math and still am. I still have nightmares about math class. Yeah, because I can&#8217;t add. I can&#8217;t do anything. I have to count on my fingers. And even that&#8217;s difficult for me.”</p>



<p>As for teachers who made a difference in his life, someone perhaps like Hunham, Paul said, “There are people who inspired the role. I don&#8217;t know if they changed my life. As much as that librarian was in the thing, I was consciously thinking of a teacher. I wouldn&#8217;t say he changed my life but he seemed very similar.”</p>



<p>“The first time I read the script, I thought of this biology teacher of mine in 10th grade, who was a very similar kind of guy. I do think what was important in that was, he was a difficult, sarcastic, not very nice guy.”</p>



<p>“He was a good teacher. And I had flashes, even as a kid, of realizing he was actually a good guy. Alexander makes an interesting distinction between nice and kind. And this guy wasn&#8217;t nice but he was kind. And that felt like the character.”</p>



<p>On whether Da’Vine being a Yale alumna was a point of connection with her, Paul confirmed, “It was, definitely. It&#8217;s a little bit of a shared boot camp experience.”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a bit the same thing of having gone to one of those prep schools. It&#8217;s a very specific thing that you understand that somebody went through.”</p>



<p>“So, yeah, there was that. And, to some extent, although she had different teachers, it&#8217;s somewhat the pedagogy, somewhat the same. So, I do think this may have been the school or not.”</p>



<p>“She and I felt akin in the way we worked and stuff like that, too. That was a person I also never had to talk to about anything because we just sort of understood.”</p>



<p>“We knew how to work with each other. And that may be Yale, or that might just be who she is, and who I am.”</p>



<p>Dominic, the film’s breakout star, makes his feature acting debut in&nbsp;<em>The Holdovers</em>. And yes, just like his Angus Tully, he went to a boarding school in real life.</p>



<p>“The first time I met Dominic was on Zoom,” Paul recounted. “They had shown me his audition tape and there was another kid they were considering. But this was the person (Dominic) they were leaning towards.”</p>

<p>“So they showed him to me and I thought he seemed amazing in so many ways. So, I said, can I meet this guy? And so, we did it on Zoom and I just loved him immediately.”</p>



<p>“He&#8217;s a really smart, lovely guy and very soft-spoken, very intelligent, very emotionally engaged. And I thought there was nobody else who could play this part. In some ways, he sort of is the guy. It was really lovely to watch him work.”</p>



<p>“He was pretty steady on his legs already,” Paul added about Dominic who originally aspired to play hockey but an injury led him to try plays at the Deerfield Academy (in Massachusetts) instead.</p>



<p>“I do feel like, yes, I could watch him relax more as the movie went on. I could watch him enjoying and letting himself play with things more and just letting it breathe more.”</p>



<p>“But everybody&#8217;s like that when you start a movie. Everybody&#8217;s nervous and needs to relax as the thing goes on. So, it wasn&#8217;t like he was that different.”</p>



<p>“He comes already pretty professional and pretty ready to go. He&#8217;s really smart and that&#8217;s a huge bonus in working with him.”</p>



<p>On his approach to making a misanthrope like Hunham relatable, and how the script helps, Paul said, “A lot of it (script) does but also, a lot of it comes from my experience with people like this. And there is a lot of charisma to these guys if they&#8217;re good at what they do.”</p>



<p>“I actually think he&#8217;s right a lot of times in what he&#8217;s saying. He&#8217;s just going about it the wrong way. So that from a starting point, I was saying to myself, I like this guy, he&#8217;s not wrong.”</p>



<p>“He&#8217;s not wrong to want to take these elitist little jerks to task – racists too, a lot of them. And I feel sympathy for him. He&#8217;s not of the same socioeconomic class either. He comes from what&#8217;s probably a working-class blue-collar background.”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s only very briefly alluded to. But it&#8217;s like he&#8217;s not from that world. Also, I think he&#8217;s funny. And I think he likes being funny. It&#8217;s brutal the way he&#8217;s being funny. But he&#8217;s taking pleasure in it.”</p>



<p>“And I remember saying to Alexander early on, this guy&#8217;s a prick but he enjoys being a prick. In some of his hitting back at some of this stuff that&#8217;s annoying, maybe it is relatable.”</p>



<p>“A lot of people would like to tell these people to go fuck themselves, these kids. So, I think that there&#8217;s a certain pleasure taken in this guy not really caring about being liked either. He&#8217;s okay with not being liked.”</p>



<p>“And there&#8217;s something great about a person like that. I have a weird affection for somebody like that. And again, he&#8217;s kind. Underneath it all, he&#8217;s a good person who does care.”</p>



<p>“He cares about the kid and he cares about teaching. I think it breaks his heart in the end to say goodbye to this kid he&#8217;s never going to see again. I think he&#8217;s a good person underneath.”</p>



<p>On the perennial is-he-a-Method-Actor question, Paul was quick to assert, “I don&#8217;t really consider myself a method actor. Sometimes I have done more what I understand that to be.”</p>



<p>“When I did the John Adams thing, that ended up almost by default being a method thing because I was there all day, every day, in costume, saying those words, and in this weird way, I just began to be the thing all the time.”</p>



<p>“But it&#8217;s a different approach every time. I have no set way. Like Alexander said, every movie is different. Every character, the approach to it is going to be different.”</p>



<p>“Sometimes it is more internal work and drawing on things that I&#8217;m familiar with and know. And sometimes it&#8217;s not. Sometimes it&#8217;s learning an accent or it&#8217;s learning how to do some physical thing.”</p>



<p>“I played a boxing manager (<em>Cinderella Man</em>). I learned all about how to wrap the hands right. how to do all the stuff with ice, and all the things to do to take care of a fighter, which was all very important to learn.”</p>



<p>“I guess it&#8217;s sort of method-y, in a way. It&#8217;s like I needed to know that stuff and sometimes I don&#8217;t feel like that. Sometimes I feel like I want to read the kinds of books the person might read.”</p>

","<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not like this (character), thank God,&#8217; Paul added about Paul Hunham, the latest of the curmudgeonly characters he has brought to life in film</p>
",https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/only-in-hollywood-will-paul-giamatti-latest-grumpy-role-lead-first-oscar-win/,2024-02-21T15:47:59,2024-02-21T16:24:19,"[16490, 629, 631]",[Only IN Hollywood] Will Paul Giamatti's latest grumpy role lead to his 1st Oscar win?,"  LOS ANGELES, USA - ""I don't think I'd ever work if I was like this. Nobody would want to employ me,"" Paul Giamatti said about his grumpy prep school teacher in  The Holdovers  for which he is ranked, along with Cillian Murphy in  Oppenheimer , as the top two contenders for the best actor Oscar come March 10.      Undoubtedly one of the best films of 2023,  The Holdovers  is also up for the Academy's Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, who is considered the frontrunner), Best Original Screenplay (David Hemingson), and Best Editing (Kevin Tent). Paul already won the Golden Globe Award, his third, for his performance in the melancholic yet engrossing film.      Set in the 1970s, the comedy-drama narrates what happens when Paul's history instructor, Da'Vine's grieving cook, and a troubled student (Dominic Sessa) are forced to remain on campus during Christmas break.             ""I suppose, in a lot of ways, they say and do the things I would never do. I'm not like this (character), thank God,"" Paul added about Paul Hunham, the latest of the curmudgeonly characters he has brought to life in film.      ""They're great characters to play. They're complicated, interesting characters. And they're often funny, which is good, too.""      While Paul has played his share of good-natured characters - from Joe Gould in  Cinderella Man  to Ralph in  Saving Mr. Banks  - he has also gifted us with memorable miscreants, villains, drunks, and plain acerbic guys.      ""There's some weird way in which it allows me to act out on something,"" the 56-year-old actor reflected in a virtual global press conference for  The Holdovers . ""It's always a question to me of, do I seek these things out unconsciously? Do I attract them? Do I just bring something to these parts? I don't know.""      ""I do think that, especially with lead roles, somebody sees you do something and they want to see you do it again, and so that's fine. That's great. They're great parts. So, I got no complaints about that.""      To his supreme credit, Hunham and Paul's other irascible characters - including Miles in  Sideways , Jerry in  Straight Outta Compton , Chief Inspector Walter Uhl in  The Illusionist , and King John in  Ironclad , to name a few - are always imbued by Paul with humanity and are never cardboard figures.      Asked if playing these crabby men is somehow his unconscious way of exorcising thoughts in the back of his mind, Paul replied, ""Probably, yeah. I mean, maybe unconsciously. I'm not so aware of what it is I need to get rid of. But obviously, something about me needs to get some of this out of me.""      ""And I used to play, and still do, a lot of rage and anger. I'm always like, am I this angry a person at some level that I need these things to get all this rage out sometimes? I don't know, maybe so.""      ""Because more and more in my own life, I do not feel like an angry, rageful person. So, it must be doing something for me.""      ""It's hard to piss me off,"" he declared. ""You can but it's not easy to piss me off. There are guys I play who are ready to be pissed off all the time. They sort of live in a state of like hair-trigger aggressive anger all the time.""      ""You never know,"" Paul answered on whether he felt his film reunion with director Alexander Payne after almost two decades since  Sideways  would create another critical and commercial access.        BTS. Director Alexander Payne and actors Paul Giamatti and Da'Vine Joy Randolph on the set of their film ‘The Holdovers.' Focus Features       ""I think because it's Alexander, you sense that you're doing something special, at least for each other, and that's the important thing. You're making something that you're all in love with and you're having a lovely time.""      ""And you hope that it gets handed over and people feel the same way about it. So, whatever the experience is, it's special with him. Then it's lovely that people embrace it as much as they do.""      ""There's a lot of basic humanity in his movies,"" Paul said about the filmmaker behind  About Schmidt ,  Election ,  Nebraska , and  The Descendants .      ""They're real people and you can relate to them. The message of connection, empathy, sound family, care for each other, and all of those things, all of the warmth and intimacy of those ideas are exemplified in the movie.""      ""It's a nice thing to feel in a really profound way like that. The world is nutty right now, in so many ways. And to have something that's about this simple drama of these three small people alone in this vast place, and they discover each other, is really beautiful.""      Paul was effusive about working with Alexander again. ""The best working relationship I've ever had. I'm friends with him, too. We have a friendship that grew over the years, too.""      ""He's the best director I've ever worked with. I think he's the best director around. It's very fun, intimate and friendly. It's like we just happen to be making a movie. We don't talk a lot about it.""      ""If an actor needs to talk a lot about stuff, he can do that but we don't talk a lot about stuff. And it's very simple things, simple direction, simple ideas. It's all very simple. And it's just fun.""      ""As a director with actors, he was the same - just better,"" Paul said about how Alexander has evolved since their 2004 collaboration. ""It was like he was even more at ease. He likes actors, which is really great. And he likes connecting with them.""      As for any link between  Sideways  and  The Holdovers , and between the eighth-grade English teacher and oenophile in the former and the Jim Beam-drinking Roman history instructor in the latter, Paul remarked, ""It's interesting - the whole relationship between the two movies.""      ""It's a funny subject that Alexander and I tiptoed around without really ever directly addressing it. It's a good, in some ways a better question for him, how much he was thinking of the other movie.""      ""It's a similar guy 20 years on, who is sort of changed in certain ways. There's a lot of similarities. There's a lot of dialogue between the two of them. It's very interesting.""      ""I can only say that I found this character different. He's a similar guy. I liked this character more. I think this guy's got more backbone and he's got more going on. He's tougher than the other guy.""      ""He's not self-pitying the way the other guy is. There's something I like about him more. Could the other guy have ended up this way? I don't know. It's different times.""      ""I think the other guy, a 20-year change could be different because there's psychotherapy and things like that. Then there are antidepressants and things.""      ""It's a very interesting question how the two movies relate. I think they do in a lot of ways but I would love to hear Alexander talk about it sometime.""      Reminded about the two characters' shared fondness for alcohol, Paul agreed: ""That's true. They both have drinking issues. So does Da'Vine's character, too. She has a little bit of an issue with drinking. And for different reasons.""        BOOZE. Da'Vine Joy Randolph stars as Mary Lamb, Dominic Sessa as Angus Tully, and Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham in director Alexander Payne's ‘The Holdovers.' Focus Features       ""It's a fun thing to do,"" Paul quipped about playing sloshed guys. ""It's an interesting thing to play, physically and emotionally. And everything about it is interesting. It's like, you're changed, and things change and the physical aspect of it is fun.""      ""I don't know why I've done it a lot. I did it on stage a lot. When I did plays, I would frequently play the guy who drinks too much on stage and I've done it in other movies, too.""      ""It's not just Alexander's (movies). I did a movie called  Barney's Version  where I play a character worse than these two guys. It really blows his life apart by drinking too much.""      ""I don't know why it comes to me but I definitely find it an interesting thing to play. It's fun in its perverse way to play it.""      Paul told Backstage in a 2019 interview: ""At drama school, if there was a drunk - especially a drunk old guy - I was absolutely a shoo-in for that part.""      But he clarified, ""No, I can only say that I'm not a big drinker off-screen. Not that I haven't been inebriated in my life. But I'm not a big drinker, no.""      The Hunham character is set apart from Paul's previous portrayals because the teacher has a lazy eye, one of the reasons why the students mock him behind his back. Not only that - the professor suffers from trimethylaminuria, defined by NHS, UK's popular website, as ""an uncommon condition that causes an unpleasant, fishy smell. It's also called 'fish odor syndrome.'""      Not surprisingly, Paul is the type who would not mind being snowbound like his Hunham in  The Holdovers . ""Blessing to me,"" he stressed. ""It sounds fantastic to me. It sounds like heaven to me. Yeah, I would love it. I would have no problem with that.""      ""I'd love nothing more than to be snowed in. I love nothing more than a blizzard and a snowstorm that shuts everything down.""      While it's well-known that Paul went to prep schools and Yale in real life, earning his BA in 1989, not many people are aware that his late father, A. Bartlett Giamatti, an English Renaissance literature professor, went on to become president of Yale from 1978 to 1986, the youngest in the university's history. His mom, Toni Marilyn Giamatti, is an English teacher.      Paul received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Yale in 2023. In awarding Paul an honorary degree, Yale also cited his work in television, including  John Adams  (title role),  Downton Abbey , and  Billions .      ""Sure,"" Paul quickly replied when asked if filming  The Holdovers  took him back to his prep school days ""Again, probably unconsciously, I did a lot. Or days when I went to a prep school like that.""      But a scene outside the prep campus was his favorite - just watching Dominic skate which was a turning point in the teacher-student's dynamics. ""The thing I enjoyed the most was the whole day we shot around the skating rink and stuff like that. It was all a day at that place doing stuff.""      ""I think it was the same day we shot the liquor store stuff but I really enjoyed shooting the ice skating stuff. Just watching him (Dominic's Angus) ice skate was a thing in the script that I really liked and was a thing that I really loved shooting.""        ODD COUPLE. Dominic Sessa stars as Angus Tully and Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham in director Alexander Payne's ‘The Holdovers.' Focus Features       ""And no words or anything like that. It was just him (Hunham, his character) beginning to see the kid (Angus) in a different way and the kid beginning to see him in a different way. There's something really lovely about that scene.""      Recalling his student days, Paul shared memories of having a teacher who reminded him a bit of his Hunham character. ""There was a teacher. I wouldn't call him a mentor but those schools are rough and the teachers are rough.""      ""He was one of the only teachers who wasn't like that. I don't want to call him a mentor but he was a nice guy.""      ""If I was interested in the subject, I was good. If I wasn't interested, I didn't work very hard.""      ""I was hopeless in math and still am. I still have nightmares about math class. Yeah, because I can't add. I can't do anything. I have to count on my fingers. And even that's difficult for me.""      As for teachers who made a difference in his life, someone perhaps like Hunham, Paul said, ""There are people who inspired the role. I don't know if they changed my life. As much as that librarian was in the thing, I was consciously thinking of a teacher. I wouldn't say he changed my life but he seemed very similar.""      ""The first time I read the script, I thought of this biology teacher of mine in 10th grade, who was a very similar kind of guy. I do think what was important in that was, he was a difficult, sarcastic, not very nice guy.""      ""He was a good teacher. And I had flashes, even as a kid, of realizing he was actually a good guy. Alexander makes an interesting distinction between nice and kind. And this guy wasn't nice but he was kind. And that felt like the character.""      On whether Da'Vine being a Yale alumna was a point of connection with her, Paul confirmed, ""It was, definitely. It's a little bit of a shared boot camp experience.""      ""It's a bit the same thing of having gone to one of those prep schools. It's a very specific thing that you understand that somebody went through.""      ""So, yeah, there was that. And, to some extent, although she had different teachers, it's somewhat the pedagogy, somewhat the same. So, I do think this may have been the school or not.""      ""She and I felt akin in the way we worked and stuff like that, too. That was a person I also never had to talk to about anything because we just sort of understood.""      ""We knew how to work with each other. And that may be Yale, or that might just be who she is, and who I am.""      Dominic, the film's breakout star, makes his feature acting debut in  The Holdovers . And yes, just like his Angus Tully, he went to a boarding school in real life.      ""The first time I met Dominic was on Zoom,"" Paul recounted. ""They had shown me his audition tape and there was another kid they were considering.

<p>BACOLOD, Philippines – The director of the Department of Education (DepEd) in Western Visayas has filed libel and other complaints against four commentators of the Radio Mindanao Network (RMN) in Iloilo City.</p>



<p>The complaints were filed separately by DepEd Regional Director Ramir Uytico on January 23, but the respondents said on Monday, February 19, that they only learned about it when they received subpoenas from the local prosecutor’s office last week.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/analysis-decriminalizing-libel/"">complaints for libel</a>, violation of the Cybercrime Prevention Act, Safe Spaces Act, and Data Privacy Act were filed by Uytico against Henry Lumawag, Novie Guazo, Regan Arlos, and Vincent Isarel &#8220;Don&#8221; Dolido.</p>



<p>Uytico, in his complaint, said the commentators criticized him on air in 2023 about issues and concerns regarding principals, teachers, and public schools, and used words that “maligned, demeaned, and damaged my person, character, and honor.”</p>



<p>He said he was called <em>agiii </em>(gay),<em> tikoh </em>(crooked), and <em>gwapa-gwapa</em> (pretty), which he felt were “very wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p>Uytico criticized the commentators for being on-air bullies and &#8220;homophobic,&#8221; who resorted to &#8220;sexist slurs&#8221; to make him a laughingstock.</p>



<p>Uytico also accused the commentators of non-adherence to ethical standards for broadcasting, putting him in a bad light, and portraying him as corrupt, which he further claimed &#8220;has no basis under the existing facts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lumawag hosts the radio program <em>Palabra de Honor;</em> Guazo and Arlos host <em>Straight to the Point</em>; and Dolido is the anchorman of <em>Targetanay sa Udto,</em> all being aired by RMN-Iloilo.</p>

<p>Lumawag was ordered to appear before Prosecutor Noel Siosan Jr. on February 20, while Guazo and Arlos were directed to go to Prosecutor Kareen de la Cruz on February 23. Meanwhile, Dolido was ordered to appear before Prosecutor Gladys Pearl Palarica, also on February 23.</p>

2606905,lockbit-cybercrime-gang-disrupted,"Lockbit cybercrime gang disrupted by Britain, US and EU","
<p>LONDON, United Kingdom – Lockbit, a notorious cybercrime gang that holds its victims&#8217; data to ransom, has been disrupted in a rare international law enforcement operation by Britain’s National Crime Agency, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, Europol, and a coalition of international police agencies, according to a post on the gang’s extortion website on Monday, February 19.</p>



<p>“This site is now under the control of the National Crime Agency of the UK, working in close cooperation with the FBI and the international law enforcement task force, ‘Operation Cronos’,” the post said.</p>



<p>An NCA spokesperson confirmed that the agency had disrupted the gang and said the operation was &#8220;ongoing and developing&#8221;.</p>



<p>A representative for Lockbit did not respond to messages from Reuters seeking comment but did post messages on an encrypted messaging app saying it had backup servers not affected by the law enforcement action.</p>



<p>The US Department of Justice and the FBI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>The post named other international police organisations from France, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland and Germany.</p>



<p>Lockbit and its affiliates have hacked some of the world’s largest organizations in recent months. The gang makes money by stealing sensitive data and threatening to leak it if victims fail to pay an extortionate ransom. Its affiliates are like-minded criminal groups that are recruited by the group to wage attacks using Lockbit’s digital extortion tools.</p>



<p>Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts data. Lockbit makes money by coercing its targets into paying ransom to decrypt or unlock that data with a digital key.</p>



<p>Lockbit was discovered in 2020 when its eponymous malicious software was found on Russian-language cybercrime forums, leading some security analysts to believe the gang is based in Russia.</p>



<p>The gang has not professed support for any government, however, and no government has formally attributed it to a nation-state. On its now-defunct darkweb site, the group said it was “located in the Netherlands, completely apolitical and only interested in money”.</p>



<p>“They are the Walmart of ransomware groups, they run it like a business – that’s what makes them different,” said Jon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at Analyst1, a US-based cybersecurity firm. “They are arguably the biggest ransomware crew today.”</p>



<p>Officials in the United States, where Lockbit has hit more than 1,700 organizations in nearly every industry from financial services and food to schools, transportation and government departments, have described the group as the world’s top ransomware threat.</p>



<p>In November last year, Lockbit published internal data from Boeing BA.N, one of the world&#8217;s largest defence and space contractors. In early 2023, Britain’s Royal Mail faced severe disruption after an attack by the group.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-highly-significant"">&#8216;Highly significant&#8217;</h5>



<p>According to vx-underground, a cybersecurity research website, Lockbit said in a statement in Russian and shared on Tox, an encrypted messaging app, that the FBI hit its servers that run on the programming language PHP. The statement, which Reuters could not verify independently, added that it has backup servers without PHP that &#8220;are not touched&#8221;.</p>



<p>On X, formerly known as Twitter, vx-underground shared screenshots showing the control panel used by Lockbit&#8217;s affiliates to launch attacks had been replaced with a message from law enforcement: &#8220;We have source code, details of the victims you have attacked, the amount of money extorted, the data stolen, chats, and much, much more&#8221;, it said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We may be in touch with you very soon&#8221; it added. &#8220;Have a nice day&#8221;.</p>



<p>Before it was taken down, Lockbit&#8217;s website displayed an ever-growing gallery of victim organisations that was updated nearly daily. Next to their names were digital clocks that showed the number of days left to the deadline given to each organisation to provide ransom payment.</p>



<p>On Monday, Lockbit’s site displayed a similar countdown, but from the law enforcement agencies who hacked the hackers: &#8220;Return here for more information at: 11:30 GMT on Tuesday 20th Feb.&#8221; the post said.</p>



<p>Don Smith, vice president of Secureworks, an arm of Dell Technologies&nbsp;DELL.N, said Lockbit was the most prolific and dominant ransomware operator in a highly competitive underground market.</p>



<p>“To put today’s takedown into context, based on leak site data, Lockbit had a 25% share of the ransomware market. Their nearest rival was Blackcat at around 8.5%, and after that it really starts to fragment,&#8221; Smith said.</p>

""This site is now under the control of the National Crime Agency of the UK, working in close cooperation with the FBI and the international law enforcement task force, 'Operation Cronos',"" the post said.      An NCA spokesperson confirmed that the agency had disrupted the gang and said the operation was ""ongoing and developing"".      A representative for Lockbit did not respond to messages from Reuters seeking comment but did post messages on an encrypted messaging app saying it had backup servers not affected by the law enforcement action.      The US Department of Justice and the FBI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.      The post named other international police organisations from France, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland and Germany.      Lockbit and its affiliates have hacked some of the world's largest organizations in recent months. The gang makes money by stealing sensitive data and threatening to leak it if victims fail to pay an extortionate ransom. Its affiliates are like-minded criminal groups that are recruited by the group to wage attacks using Lockbit's digital extortion tools.      Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts data. Lockbit makes money by coercing its targets into paying ransom to decrypt or unlock that data with a digital key.      Lockbit was discovered in 2020 when its eponymous malicious software was found on Russian-language cybercrime forums, leading some security analysts to believe the gang is based in Russia.      The gang has not professed support for any government, however, and no government has formally attributed it to a nation-state. On its now-defunct darkweb site, the group said it was ""located in the Netherlands, completely apolitical and only interested in money"".      ""They are the Walmart of ransomware groups, they run it like a business - that's what makes them different,"" said Jon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at Analyst1, a US-based cybersecurity firm. ""They are arguably the biggest ransomware crew today.""      Officials in the United States, where Lockbit has hit more than 1,700 organizations in nearly every industry from financial services and food to schools, transportation and government departments, have described the group as the world's top ransomware threat.      In November last year, Lockbit published internal data from Boeing BA.N, one of the world's largest defence and space contractors. In early 2023, Britain's Royal Mail faced severe disruption after an attack by the group.      ‘Highly significant'      According to vx-underground, a cybersecurity research website, Lockbit said in a statement in Russian and shared on Tox, an encrypted messaging app, that the FBI hit its servers that run on the programming language PHP. The statement, which Reuters could not verify independently, added that it has backup servers without PHP that ""are not touched"".      On X, formerly known as Twitter, vx-underground shared screenshots showing the control panel used by Lockbit's affiliates to launch attacks had been replaced with a message from law enforcement: ""We have source code, details of the victims you have attacked, the amount of money extorted, the data stolen, chats, and much, much more"", it said.      ""We may be in touch with you very soon"" it added. ""Have a nice day"".      Before it was taken down, Lockbit's website displayed an ever-growing gallery of victim organisations that was updated nearly daily. Next to their names were digital clocks that showed the number of days left to the deadline given to each organisation to provide ransom payment.      On Monday, Lockbit's site displayed a similar countdown, but from the law enforcement agencies who hacked the hackers: ""Return here for more information at: 11:30 GMT on Tuesday 20th Feb."" the post said.      Don Smith, vice president of Secureworks, an arm of Dell Technologies DELL.N, said Lockbit was the most prolific and dominant ransomware operator in a highly competitive underground market.      ""To put today's takedown into context, based on leak site data, Lockbit had a 25% share of the ransomware market. Their nearest rival was Blackcat at around 8.5%, and after that it really starts to fragment,"" Smith said.      ""Lockbit dwarfed all other groups and today's action is highly significant.""  - Rappler.com   ",Neutral

<p>CEBU, Philippines – Cebu is a birthing place of <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/65479-taipans-cebu/"">wealth and fortune</a> – an island with clans that have influenced Philippine commerce and industry since the 19th century.</p>



<p>From the Gokongweis and the Gotianuns to the Aboitizes and Lhuilliers, each of the families have made their mark in ventures that have contributed to the province’s economic development as well as the nation&#8217;s growth. </p>



<p>In 2023, Cebu was named <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/list-richest-cities-municipalities-provinces-commission-audit-annual-financial-report-2022/#:~:text=Richest%20provinces,with%20the%20previous%20year's%20standings."">the richest province in the country</a> with P235.738 billion in declared assets based on the 2022 Commission on Audit (COA) Annual Financial Report. This was followed by the province of Rizal with P35.6 billion in declared assets for 2022.</p>



<p>But beyond the art of trade and profit, a majority of the clans’ front-runners like the late <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/244577-how-john-gokongwei-jr-built-empire-selling-peanuts/"">John Gokongwei Jr.</a> attributed their success to their ancestors’ humble beginnings and the ports of Cebu.</p>



<p>Between 1830 to 1893, Cebu saw a huge expansion in international trade alongside a wave of Chinese immigration. These enterprising travelers grew their present-day empires from small retail stores and vessel ownership in Cebu’s <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/buddha-santo-nino-cebu-chinoys-faith-spirituality/"">“lutao” district</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among those clans that considered the Cebuano harbors their home were the Gothongs – one of Cebu’s biggest shipping tycoons.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-tradesman-s-memories"">Tradesman&#8217;s memories</h5>



<p>For the Gothongs, it all started with a man called &#8220;Go Bon Tho,&#8221; or more popularly known locally as “Don Carlos A. Gothong Sr.”</p>



<p>Don Carlos was a Chinese immigrant from Fujian, a province located southeast of China. In 1910, he left Fujian for the Philippines with the help of his relatives who sponsored his travel.</p>



<p>“He took his first haven in Manila and later resettled in San Isidro, Leyte. The place was close to his heart because he was able to work immediately with Chinese residents who were always sympathetic and helpful to new arrivals,” the <a href=""https://www.gothongsouthern.com/about"">Gothong Southern Group</a> website read.</p>



<p>During this period, Don Carlos worked as a salesman until he had amassed enough wealth to invest in abaca trading and general retail. By 1915, he was able to pursue business on his own and found home in Kawayan town, Leyte.</p>



<p>Don Carlos went back to China in 1924 and married Dee He Chiok, later known as Doña Rita Dee. After their marriage, the couple returned to the Philippines in 1925 and had 10 children.</p>



<p>Around the 1930s, Don Carlos founded Carlos A. Go Thong and bought the <em>MV Ramses</em>, a small vessel which he used to ship commodities and general merchandise to different islands in Visayas and Mindanao.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While a tragic fire incident had struck their store in Leyte in 1935, Don Carlos immediately bounced back with the help of fellow Chinese businessmen and even went into baking and rice and corn milling.</p>



<p>When the Japanese invaded the Philippines in 1941, Don Carlos and his family fled to Daanbantayan town in Cebu fearing the accusations against him of supporting rebel groups and plans to use his resources against the Philippine government.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Family matters</h5>



<p>Family was an important part of Don Carlos’ undertakings, especially at the end of the Japanese occupation in the country.</p>



<p>In 1946, Don Carlos moved out of Daanbantayan to settle in Cebu City. At the same time, he submitted documents to the Bureau of Commerce and Industry as part of his plans for a fresh start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the papers were approved, Carlos A. Gothong &amp; Co. officially began its operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With him as general manager, his brother Sulpicio as manager, and son Alfredo as treasurer, the business grew to greater heights with their immersion into copra trading and acquisition of more freight ships.</p>



<p>“It was in the 1960s that the company spread its sails as it embarked on foreign cargo shipping and gave birth to Universal Shipping Lines. It covered the ports of Amsterdam, France, Italy, Singapore, Hongkong, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Taiwan, Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe, and the Philippine Islands among others,” the <a href=""https://www.gothongsouthern.com/about"">Gothong Southern Group</a> website read.</p>



<p>However, the success that Don Carlos gained from his business was not enough for him. This manifested in his journey into philanthropy where he spent an ample amount of time on wealth-building and contributing to schools in the Visayas and Mindanao.</p>



<p>Don Carlos also spent time with his grandchildren, ensuring that they learned the most valuable lessons in commerce and economics.</p>



<p>“I remember how he would always place a 25-centavo coin on the dining table and whoever finished first amongst almost a dozen siblings and cousins would get the coin,” Roberto Gothong, CEO of the Gothong Southern Group of Companies, told Rappler.</p>



<p>In March 1996, Don Carlos passed away. According to the family, more than 5,000 families, including public servants and tycoons, sent flowers, letters, and beneficence during the wake.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Alfredo and sons</h5>



<p>After the founder’s death, Carlos A. Gothong &amp; Co. also met its end in 1972. Shares were divided among the brothers, Sulpicio, Lorenzo, and Camilo, and also Don Carlos’ son Alfredo.</p>



<p>“Alfredo and Sulpicio got 32.5% each of the company’s shares, Lorenzo got 22.5% share and Camilo got 12.5%,” the company website read.</p>



<p>Sulpicio and Lorenzo went on to establish their own shipping companies, while Alfredo incorporated the original company into Carlos A. Gothong Lines, Incorporated (CAGLI) on April 6, 1973.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 1985, Alfredo’s sons who had finished their studies abroad, took over the family business and expanded it to now enter the fields of real estate, hospitality, and transport, among others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roberto “Bob” Gothong, the second eldest, graduated from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada in 1977 with a bachelor’s degree in commerce, majoring in transportation and utilities and minor in finance. In 1988, Bob founded Ottawa Freight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, he is the head of the Gothong Southern Group of Companies, which was born five years after Gothong Southern Shipping Lines was founded and began its freight cargo and passenger operations in 2005.</p>



<p>Bob’s daughter, Caroline Gothong Ong, is the deputy chief executive officer of Gothong Southern Shipping. His sons, Ceferino and Carlistito, also adopted roles as board members of the Gothong Southern Group of Companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My son Ceferino Gothong is with our Treasury…my youngest son Carlostito is also the managing director of Yello Hotel, and property management head at Gothong Southern Properties,” the Gothong patriarch told Rappler.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"">Hundred-year legacy</h5>



<p>As a Gothong, Roberto takes pride in the clan’s role as nation builders.</p>



<p>“When Typhoon Yolanda devastated Tacloban, our <em>M/V Don Alfredo Sr.</em> was the first vessel to enter Tacloban with relief goods donated by various charitable institutions and ourselves,” Roberto told Rappler.</p>



<p>It was during this time that the Gothongs brought generator sets to light up port areas in Cebu and shipped relief goods from anywhere in the Philippines straight to Tacloban.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When Typhoon Odette damaged Cebu in 2021, we helped transport relief goods for free from all over the country. Our organization provided free water not only for our own people, but also for the surrounding neighborhood where we hold office,” Roberto said.</p>



<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Gothongs also helped medical front-liners by providing them with free Yellow Care Bikes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Roberto, the family has its own constitution that “speaks of establishing a 100-year-old legacy and beyond.”</p>



<p>To perform such a feat, Roberto said, members of the family’s 4th generation – what the Gothongs refer to as “Gen C” – must undergo a mentorship program led by <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/240022-interview-enrique-soriano-challenges-managing-family-business/"">Enrique Soriano III</a>, a family business advisor and Ateneo de Manila University professor.</p>



<p>By 2025, the family hopes to achieve its vision of becoming a top fifth-party logistics provider with a net worth of P5 billion.</p>

<p>MANILA, Philippines – Polytechnic University of the Philippines students are protesting certain provisions in proposed bills seeking to amend the PUP charter which will pave the way for the privatization and commercialization of services inside the campus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The students held protest actions following the February 12 House hearing on the proposed bills.</p>



<p>Under House Bill No. 8860, PUP&#8217;s governing board shall have the power and duty to enter joint ventures with business and industry for PUP&#8217;s profitable development and management of economic assets. It also allows privatization in managing non-academic services in the school including health, food, and building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sandigan ng Mag-aaral para sa Sambayanan (SAMASA PUP) chairperson Ronjay-C Mendiola told the House committee on higher and technical education, which is conducting hearings on the proposed bills, that the privatization may increase the prices of food and other products of stall concessionaires inside the main campus. </p>



<p>He said this will also affect student organizations who have to rent school venues for their events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Baguio City Representative Mark Go, House panel chairman, explained that the proposed provision is a broad function for the governing board to exercise. This, he said, should be appreciated in the context of benefits for the whole university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lawmaker also argued that even if the national government has to allocate a budget for state universities like PUP, state universities also have to generate internal incomes and not just rely on the national government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mendiola told Rappler that the proposed provision will allow the government to &#8220;escape its responsibility&#8221; of prioritizing funds for state universities and colleges.</p>



<p>“<em>Pinapatakas natin &#8216;yung government doon sa responsibility na sila dapat ang nagbibigay o tumutugon. &#8216;Pag umoo tayo na magkaroon ng income-generating projects, kung pipiliin ng university na magkaroon ng ganito, parang inaabswelto na natin ang government doon sa pag-mi-misprioritize nila ng budget</em>,” Mendiola said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(We&#8217;re allowing the government to escape its responsibility that it should be the one giving or addressing [funding]. If we allow the existence of income-generating projects, if the university will favor this, it would seem like we&#8217;re absolving the government of misprioritizing the budget.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>PUP student regent Miss Kim Modelo clarified that students support the other provisions in the bills, including the appropriation of an P8-billion budget for the university, which is higher than its P3-billion* budget for 2024. <em>(*Editor&#8217;s Note: An earlier version of this story indicated a 6-billion budget; this has been corrected.)</em></p>



<p>Modelo also called for more consultation with PUP&#8217;s stakeholders, including teachers and non-teaching personnel, on the proposed bills.</p>



<p>During the hearing, PUP president Manuel Muhi reiterated that elevating the state university to a premier academic status will allow the school to address gaps in education and employment, design programs tailored for a modern work setting, and assist other polytechnic schools in the Philippines. It will also subsume various campuses that are currently funded by local government units.</p>



<p>Then-president Rodrigo Duterte vetoed the bill in 2019 due to “serious reservations.” </p>



<p>This is not the first time that joint ventures in state universities and colleges were criticized by stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Republic Act No. 9500, which strengthened the University of the Philippines (UP) into a national university in 2008, vested the UP Board of Regents with the power to approve joint ventures. </p>



<p>On February 6, UP Diliman students <a href=""https://x.com/ujpupdiliman/status/1754837126980551099?s=20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">protested</a>&nbsp;the increasing commercialization of campus spaces in the national university. Various food stalls in the campus were told to end their operations in February to make way for the March opening of DiliMall, the former UP Shopping Center.</p>



<p>In January 2023, the Samahang Manininda sa UP Campus&nbsp;<a href=""https://phkule.org/article/765/up-maninindas-blast-new-food-hub-as-anti-poor"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">slammed</a>&nbsp;the opening of the UP Diliman Gyud Food Hub, another avenue of concessionaires managed by private partners of UP, for not giving spaces for small campus vendors. </p>

Under House Bill No. 8860, PUP's governing board shall have the power and duty to enter joint ventures with business and industry for PUP's profitable development and management of economic assets. It also allows privatization in managing non-academic services in the school including health, food, and building.       Sandigan ng Mag-aaral para sa Sambayanan (SAMASA PUP) chairperson Ronjay-C Mendiola told the House committee on higher and technical education, which is conducting hearings on the proposed bills, that the privatization may increase the prices of food and other products of stall concessionaires inside the main campus.       He said this will also affect student organizations who have to rent school venues for their events.       Baguio City Representative Mark Go, House panel chairman, explained that the proposed provision is a broad function for the governing board to exercise. This, he said, should be appreciated in the context of benefits for the whole university.       The lawmaker also argued that even if the national government has to allocate a budget for state universities like PUP, state universities also have to generate internal incomes and not just rely on the national government.       Mendiola told Rappler that the proposed provision will allow the government to ""escape its responsibility"" of prioritizing funds for state universities and colleges.      "" Pinapatakas natin ‘yung government doon sa responsibility na sila dapat ang nagbibigay o tumutugon. ‘Pag umoo tayo na magkaroon ng income-generating projects, kung pipiliin ng university na magkaroon ng ganito, parang inaabswelto na natin ang government doon sa pag-mi-misprioritize nila ng budget ,"" Mendiola said.       (We're allowing the government to escape its responsibility that it should be the one giving or addressing [funding]. If we allow the existence of income-generating projects, if the university will favor this, it would seem like we're absolving the government of misprioritizing the budget.)       PUP student regent Miss Kim Modelo clarified that students support the other provisions in the bills, including the appropriation of an P8-billion budget for the university, which is higher than its P3-billion* budget for 2024.  (*Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story indicated a 6-billion budget; this has been corrected.)       Modelo also called for more consultation with PUP's stakeholders, including teachers and non-teaching personnel, on the proposed bills.      During the hearing, PUP president Manuel Muhi reiterated that elevating the state university to a premier academic status will allow the school to address gaps in education and employment, design programs tailored for a modern work setting, and assist other polytechnic schools in the Philippines. It will also subsume various campuses that are currently funded by local government units.      Then-president Rodrigo Duterte vetoed the bill in 2019 due to ""serious reservations.""       This is not the first time that joint ventures in state universities and colleges were criticized by stakeholders.       Republic Act No. 9500, which strengthened the University of the Philippines (UP) into a national university in 2008, vested the UP Board of Regents with the power to approve joint ventures.       On February 6, UP Diliman students  protested  the increasing commercialization of campus spaces in the national university. Various food stalls in the campus were told to end their operations in February to make way for the March opening of DiliMall, the former UP Shopping Center.      In January 2023, the Samahang Manininda sa UP Campus  slammed  the opening of the UP Diliman Gyud Food Hub, another avenue of concessionaires managed by private partners of UP, for not giving spaces for small campus vendors.       In a 2016  article , UP Diliman student publication Philippine Collegian reported that the Commission on Audit (COA) flagged the millions of unpaid obligations of Ayala Land for both the Technohub and the UP Town Center, which ""deprived"" the stockholders of benefits for the supposed additional funding. COA had directed UP to bill ALI for this. -  Rappler.com        Chris Burnet Ramos is an Aries Rufo fellow.

<p><strong>PHILIPPINE EDUCATION.</strong> Speaking of DepEd, Bonz Magsambol reminds us in this story, <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/why-filipino-students-lagging-behind-global-assessments-tests/"">&#8220;Why Filipino students performed poorly in global learning assessments,&#8221;</a> that after close to two years, Sara Duterte has yet to introduce meaningful reforms in her own jurisdiction: education. In the <a href=""https://www.oecd.org/publication/pisa-2022-results/country-notes/philippines-a0882a2d/?"">2022 Programme for International Student Assessment</a>, the Philippines ranked close to the bottom (77th out of 81 countries) in global listings. Our 15-year-old students demonstrated “the lowest proficiency…in reading, mathematics, and science,” Bonz wrote. How tragic and worrisome is that?</p>



<p>What were some of the reasons for this? Teaching and learning methods, teacher quality, and inadequate resources.</p>



<p>In fairness to the Vice President and Education Secretary, she inherited problems from her father’s previous administration, which also had to deal with a debilitating pandemic that left many ill-equipped schools and teachers flat-footed. Inadequate resources adversely affected agility, but for sure, Sara’s inexperience in the field of education (being a mother is clearly not enough) exacerbated the situation. Can she help Filipino students bounce back and drastically rise from the bottom of rankings?</p>



<p><strong>POLITICAL PRISONERS.</strong> After reminders about mortality and love this week, we ought not to forget, too, prisoners put behind bars for political reasons. Data obtained by Rappler’s <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/author/lian-buan/"">Lian Buan</a> from rights group Karapatan and support organization Kapatid show that there are 801 <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/data-documents/political-prisoners-average-wait-time-jail-while-trial/"">political prisoners</a> in the country, 672 of them still awaiting judgment. On average, they wait for four years to be judged, but there are 27 who have been incarcerated for more than a decade already.</p>



<p>Under Duterte, many were red-tagged or accused of being communists (not a crime here in the Philippines because the Communist Party is not outlawed). They have languished in prison, their trial taking longer – in violation of the Supreme Court’s six-month-average continuous trial rule that took effect in 2017. Under the current Marcos administration, at least 90 have been arrested and put in jail.</p>



<p>According to Lian, if before activists were charged with subversion, now “most political prisoners are charged with common crimes, often illegal possession of firearms and explosives…”</p>



<p>Irene Khan, United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, had recommended during her recent visit here that Marcos <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/un-special-rapporteur-irene-khan-recommends-marcos-government-abolish-ntf-elcac/"">abolish the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict</a>.

<p>A quarrel among several people sparked the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/kansas-city-super-bowl-parade-shooting-february-14-2024/"">shooting spree in Kansas City</a>, Missouri, that killed a woman and wounded 22 people after a celebration of the city&#8217;s NFL Super Bowl victory, police said on Thursday, February 16, ruling out any apparent link to extremism.</p>



<p>Two minors and an adult have been detained as &#8220;subjects&#8221; in the investigation, Police Chief Stacey Graves said at a press conference, the day after gunfire erupted in the vicinity of the city&#8217;s historic downtown rail station.</p>



<p>The adult was later released, according to local media.</p>



<p>The Kansas City Star, quoting a police spokesperson, reported the third detainee was not implicated in the shooting and that police were working with juvenile prosecutors to &#8220;determine applicable charges&#8221; against the two minors held in custody.</p>



<p>The police chief told reporters several firearms had been recovered from the shooting scene.</p>



<p>&#8220;This appears to be a dispute between several people that ended in gunfire,&#8221; she said, suggesting the violence was incidental to the celebration rather than a targeted attack.</p>



<p>&#8220;Preliminary investigative findings have show there is no nexus to terrorism or homegrown violent extremism,&#8221; Graves said.</p>



<p>The chief did not elaborate on what police knew about the origins of the precipitating clash or details of the shooting itself, including whether gang activity was involved.</p>



<p>Wednesday&#8217;s parade and rally celebrating the Chiefs&#8217; Super Bowl triumph over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday had drawn upward of a million fans, Graves said, and the sound of gunshots as the event was breaking up sent throngs scrambling for cover.</p>



<p>Two fans attending the rally ended up tackling and detaining one of the three suspects.</p>



<p>In Thursday&#8217;s briefing, police raised the tally of known gunshot victims to 23, and said their ages ranged from 8 to 47. Lisa Lopez-Galvan, a popular local radio personality, was the lone fatality.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have all intentions of presenting charges,&#8221; Graves said of the suspects in custody. Their identities were not disclosed.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-more-suspects"">More suspects?</h5>



<p>Police sought to determine if anybody else was involved in the shooting, and the chief said everyone responsible would be &#8220;brought to justice.&#8221;</p>



<p>Children&#8217;s Mercy Hospital said it treated the nine children who were shot and all were expected to recover. Two other children with non-gunshot injuries and an adult victim were also treated there, the hospital said.</p>



<p>The Jackson County prosecutor, Jean Peters Baker, who will decide on any criminal charges, vowed on social media on Thursday to &#8220;use every tool at my disposal under Missouri law that allows me to address this tragedy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Baker&#8217;s office said by phone that charges could come as early as Thursday afternoon.</p>



<p>It was the latest high-profile outburst of gun violence in the US, where such incidents have erupted with increasing frequency in schools, supermarkets, nightclubs and other public settings.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is an all-too-real American problem,&#8221; Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told KMBC-TV. &#8220;But so long as we have fools who will commit these types of acts, as long as we have their access to firearms at this level of capacity&#8230;we may see incidents like this one.&#8221;</p>



<p>The mayor said plans would proceed for a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day parade next month. He said Wednesday&#8217;s shooting &#8220;does not mean that Kansas City will stop having events.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kansas City’s 182 murders in 2023 were an all-time record, surpassing the 176 tallied in 2020. More than one in 10 homicide victims in 2023 were under the age of 18, according to police statistics.</p>



<p>The barrage of gunfire on Wednesday unfolded near the city&#8217;s landmark Union Station, whose front entrance was the backdrop to the stage for the victory rally. Hundreds of law enforcement personnel were present.</p>



<p>The Super Bowl celebration featured Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce on stage with quarterback Patrick Mahomes and other teammates, but Kelce&#8217;s pop superstar girlfriend, Taylor Swift, was back on tour in Australia.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am heartbroken over the tragedy that took place today,&#8221; Kelce posted on X late on Wednesday. &#8220;My heart is with all who came out to celebrate with us and have been affected. KC, you mean the world to me.&#8221; – <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>Three people were in custody in Kansas City, Missouri, on Thursday, February 15, facing questions about what led to a deadly mass shooting near the city&#8217;s Super Bowl victory rally and who was behind it.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/kansas-city-super-bowl-parade-shooting-february-14-2024/"">At least one person was killed and 21 others wounded</a> by gunfire on Wednesday outside the city&#8217;s landmark Union Station, where thousands of fans had gathered with the Kansas City Chiefs to celebrate the team&#8217;s NFL championship triumph over the San Francisco 49ers, authorities said.</p>



<p>The bloodshed, which came at the end of the rally following a parade, turned the festive occasion into a scene of panic as throngs of attendees scrambled for cover at the sound of rapid-fire gunshots.</p>



<p>Local radio station KKFI identified the slain victim as Lisa Lopez, one of its disc jockeys and host of the show &#8220;Taste of Tejano.&#8221; Fifteen other victims suffered life-threatening wounds, Fire Department Chief Ross Grundyson said at a late-afternoon news conference.</p>



<p>Eleven of those hurt by gunfire or the ensuing pandemonium were children as young as 6, officials said.</p>



<p>None of the&nbsp;football team, their coaches or other staff attending the rally was injured, the team said.</p>



<p>Police chief Stacey Graves told a Wednesday evening news conference three people were detained &#8220;and under investigation&#8221; in connection with the shooting, but she said investigators had yet to determine a motive.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-circumstances-remain-murky"">Circumstances remain murky</h5>



<p>She said police were still unsure whether the Super Bowl victory celebration was targeted for attack, or whether the violence was incidental to the event and spilled over into it.</p>



<p>Authorities appealed to anyone who had information about the shooting or video that might help shed light on what transpired to share it with police.</p>



<p>Graves said she was aware of video purporting to show fans subduing a suspect, and that investigators were reviewing the footage to determine if the individual was one of the people taken into police custody.</p>



<p>Parade attendee Paul Contreras, told local television station KETV he was one of the fans who helped tackle the man, and saw him drop a gun when he was knocked down.</p>



<p>&#8220;The whole time he&#8217;s fighting to get up and run away,&#8221; Paul said, adding police arrived within moments. &#8220;We&#8217;re fighting each other, you know. We&#8217;re fighting to keep him down and he&#8217;s fighting to get up.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas lamented that city authorities ultimately were unable to prevent such violence despite the presence of more than 800 law enforcement officers, including federal agents, on security detail for the event.</p>



<p>&#8220;Parades, rallies, schools, movies &#8211; it seems like almost nothing is safe,&#8221;&nbsp;Quinton, a Democrat, told reporters, recounting how he was among those who ran for cover at the sound of gunfire.</p>

<p>With their jobs entailing them to be committed to their sport virtually 24/7 – from hectic trainings to strict diet plans to gym workouts on non-game days – it takes dedication and passion to keep hearts flaming.</p>



<p>Several athletes, though, continue to thrive on the hard court, while still making their personal relationships work off it.</p>

<p>Veteran volleyball star Aby Maraño of Chery Tiggo and Nxled&#8217;s Kamille Cal make sure to keep tabs on each other even as they face off in the Premier Volleyball League (PVL).</p>

<p>“So, there are times that I look out for her, and she looks out for me. In the end, we encourage each other to be the best version of ourselves.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Volleyball standout Denden Lazaro and husband, former basketball player LA Revilla, agree that dealing with the same struggles leads to a more patient and understanding relationship.</p>



<p>And in their case, even transcending school rivalries as Lazaro suited up for Ateneo and Revilla for La Salle during their collegiate primes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both players earned UAAP championships for their respective schools, with Lazaro helping lead Ateneo to two titles along with Alyssa Valdez, and Revilla serving as a steady point guard in the Green Archers&#8217; 2013 title run.</p>



<p>“He understands my very hectic schedule, one that even on holidays, there are no days off,” Lazaro said of her relationship with Revilla.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He understands the fatigue that even when I have a free day, I’d rather just want that to be my rest day.”</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-time-management"">Time management</h5>



<p>Lazaro shares they understand the need to sacrifice whenever they have games or trainings that fall on special days like Valentine’s Day, or even on holidays.</p>



<p>“On Valentine’s Day, he knows I have training, I’m tired. But that’s okay, we can spend the rest of our lives celebrating,” said a beaming Lazaro.</p>



<p>The couple tied the knot in 2020, a year after announcing their engagement.</p>



<p>Since their marriage, Revilla has shifted to coaching, helping shape the next generation of basketball players as an assistant coach of the UE Red Warriors.</p>

<p>Galerie Tower&#8217;s Shola Alvarez, who is engaged to former F2 Logistics teammate Tin Tiamzon, agrees that time management plays a major factor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, Alvarez and Tiamzon showed how much they’re thriving as they&nbsp; jointly announced their engagement in August after a couple of years together.</p>



<p>“Actually, it comes down to time management, especially when fatigue comes, that is when one needs to exert effort for their partner,” shared Alvarez.</p>



<p>Tiamzon, though, will shift roles from player to supporter starting this year as  the Fil-Canadian announced her retirement from volleyball last January after the Cargo Movers disbanded their PVL squad.</p>

With their jobs entailing them to be committed to their sport virtually 24/7 - from hectic trainings to strict diet plans to gym workouts on non-game days - it takes dedication and passion to keep hearts flaming.

2602605,nbi-investigation-bomb-threats-government-offices-february-2024,NBI to probe bomb threats vs gov&#8217;t offices,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – Following the bomb threats targeting government offices, Justice Secretary Boying Remulla ordered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to conduct an investigation in collaboration with the Japan police attaché and other concerned law enforcement agencies. </p>



<p>The office of the Department of Education (DepEd) in Bataan received a bomb threat via email on Monday morning, prompting the agency to suspend office work and instruct schools to hold asynchronous classes instead.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) said in a statement that it received a similar threat at around 10 am. DENR employees were immediately evacuated.</p>



<p>The Department of Science and Technology (DOST), too, was disrupted by the threats. </p>



<p>The sender of the bomb threats used the name Takahiro Karasawa, the same Japanese handle used by those who threatened the MRT-3 system last September 2023.</p>



<p>The NBI noted that the name Karasawa was also associated with bomb threats in different countries. </p>



<p>&#8220;This alarming pattern emphasizes the need for immediate and decisive action,&#8221; the NBI said in a statement.</p>



<p>The justice department and the NBI said they were taking the matter &#8220;extremely seriously and will be dealt with accordingly, in full compliance with the law.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The NBI is committed to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation, leaving no stone unturned in the pursuit of justice,&#8221; said NBI director Medardo de Lemos. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s been exactly a week when some members of the House of Representatives reportedly <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/house-representatives-heightened-alert-congressmen-receive-bomb-threat-february-5-2024/"">received</a> bomb threats. This raised security measures at the Batasang Pambansa complex.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-hoaxes"">Hoaxes</h5>



<p>The PNP later described the threats at DepEd and DENR as hoaxes.</p>



<p>“Upon thorough investigation in cooperation with the Philippine National Police, the information being circulated has been verified to be a hoax,” the DENR said in a statement.</p>



<p>“The DENR calls for vigilant sobriety and advises everyone to immediately report suspicious activity to local authorities.”</p>

<p>The Quezon City Police Department said there were “no signs of any bombs or any improvised explosive device” in the DENR central office.</p>



<p>Bataan Governor Joet Garcia told the public to be vigilant of content they see online.</p>

The office of the Department of Education (DepEd) in Bataan received a bomb threat via email on Monday morning, prompting the agency to suspend office work and instruct schools to hold asynchronous classes instead.      Meanwhile, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) said in a statement that it received a similar threat at around 10 am. DENR employees were immediately evacuated.      The Department of Science and Technology (DOST), too, was disrupted by the threats.       The sender of the bomb threats used the name Takahiro Karasawa, the same Japanese handle used by those who threatened the MRT-3 system last September 2023.      The NBI noted that the name Karasawa was also associated with bomb threats in different countries.       ""This alarming pattern emphasizes the need for immediate and decisive action,"" the NBI said in a statement.      The justice department and the NBI said they were taking the matter ""extremely seriously and will be dealt with accordingly, in full compliance with the law.""      ""The NBI is committed to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation, leaving no stone unturned in the pursuit of justice,"" said NBI director Medardo de Lemos.       It's been exactly a week when some members of the House of Representatives reportedly  received  bomb threats. This raised security measures at the Batasang Pambansa complex.      Hoaxes      The PNP later described the threats at DepEd and DENR as hoaxes.      ""Upon thorough investigation in cooperation with the Philippine National Police, the information being circulated has been verified to be a hoax,"" the DENR said in a statement.      ""The DENR calls for vigilant sobriety and advises everyone to immediately report suspicious activity to local authorities.""          UPDATE.

<p><em>Rappler’s Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr. Margarita Holmes.</em></p>



<p><em>Jeremy has a master’s degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives</em>.</p>



<p><em>Together, they have written two books: </em>Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality<em> and </em>Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons.</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>



<p><strong><em>Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer:</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>I had a brother three years younger than me. When it was time for him to go to</em></strong> <strong><em>college, all he wanted was to go to UP, but my father insisted that he go to DLSU</em></strong> <strong><em>instead. My father was worried UP might make him a communist or a frat boy.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>My brother, who had exceptional grades and was admired for being the</em></strong> <strong><em>brightest student in his grade and high schools, was probably bored at La Salle, because he was always getting into trouble. The last straw was when he had an</em></strong> <strong><em>argument with his teacher and, when it was obvious he was right, the teacher</em></strong> <strong><em>threw an eraser at him, which he promptly threw back at the teacher. For</em></strong> <strong><em>that he was expelled.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>My brother never stopped resenting my father for what he (and I) saw as</em></strong> <strong><em>my father’s rigid view of education and lack of trust in my brother’s ability to</em></strong> <strong><em>make correct choices. Things were never the same between them after this. My</em></strong> <strong><em>brother’s chances for a good college education were also deeply affected by his</em></strong> <strong><em>expulsion from DLSU. My father then moved heaven and earth to enroll him in</em></strong> <strong><em>UP, but by then my brother said it was “too little, too late.”</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Fast forward to now, 45 years later. My daughter has also been called “genius</em></strong> <strong><em>material” by her high school professors. She, too, wants to go to UP. Her father is</em></strong> <strong><em>adamant she goes to a “good Catholic school” like Ateneo, DLSU, UST. My</em></strong> <strong><em>daughter is heartbroken about his decision and begged me to intervene.</em></strong> </p>



<p><strong><em>I usually don’t like to do that as it makes my husband very angry. But I do</em></strong> <strong><em>not want a repeat of my brother’s story. Please help. </em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>SAD SISTER and WORRIED MOM</em></strong></p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>



<p>Dear SAD SISTER and WORRIED MOM (SSWM),</p>



<p>While your father is simply one of many who thought (still think?) that a Catholic college is a safer prospect than UP, his failure to nurture his own son’s talent and potential was a tragic misstep from which there was apparently no redemption. As for your brother, his contribution seems to be to have acted out of sheer pique, thus emulating the immaturity and petulance shown by his DLSU professor.</p>



<p>One generation later, history is repeating itself, possibly in a case of intergenerational trauma (<a href=""https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-  intergenerational-trauma"">for background see this, for example</a>). Another narrow-minded father is following his own prejudices and ignoring the best interests of his child. </p>



<p>Meanwhile you are caught in the middle, having to choose between supporting your daughter’s efforts to go to UP and thus incurring the ire of your husband, or maintaining good relations with your husband and condemning your daughter to an arguably inferior education (I must confess to possible bias here – I am not a fan of Catholic educational establishments, having been an &#8220;inmate&#8221; at one, and my wife is a UP alumna and former UP professor).</p>



<p>So what to do, SSWM?</p>



<p>You have chosen a husband with striking similarities to your own father: dictatorial, convinced of his own infallibility, unwilling to brook dissent, and no great believer that marriage involves open communication between equals or that the aim of parenthood is to unleash the full potential of one’s children.</p>



<p>Even if it might be an exercise in futility, you should try to reason with him dispassionately, arguing that your daughter’s wishes should be taken seriously since she is her own person and should be entitled to her own autonomy (within certain limits perhaps). The arguments for and against UP should be fully discussed and perhaps there is room to allay some, if not all, of your husband’s concerns.</p>



<p>The aim after all is to support your daughter’s journey to full adulthood and independence by allowing her increasingly to make her own life choices. Love for one’s children should not be expressed by punitive actions or insistence that parental aspirations should take precedence. Your daughter is after all her own distinct and separate person.</p>



<p>Should your husband prove obdurate however, then the harsh realities of life and the state of your marriage will apply. You will have to decide whether you have the will and/or the means to test the limits of your relationship and resist his unilateral efforts to impose his world view on the rest of his family. </p>



<p>Best wishes,<br>JAF Baer</p>

<p>Dear SSWM:</p>



<p>Thank you very much for your letter. I agree with everything Mr. Baer has written, except for the first statement in the penultimate paragraph, which includes the suggestion that you “try to reason with (your husband) dispassionately.”</p>



<p>I am fairly sure you, as all young brides do, have tried to convince your husband (let’s call him Ed) in the past. This is part and parcel of marriage, after all. However, I am also fairly sure that you discovered early on that Ed is not a dispassionate man.&nbsp; This is why you “usually don’t like to do that (intervene) as it makes my husband very angry.”</p>



<p>Up until now, your decision to let Ed have his way (or let Ed <em>think </em>he is getting his own way) has worked well in your marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your daughter (let’s call her Monica) wants to go to UP; Ed insists she go somewhere else. What is at stake here is not the actual school Monica goes to – a genius who applies herself will succeed no matter how limited and “Katoliko cerrado” (hence narrow in perspective) the approach of the university she goes to. As long as she behaves differently from her uncle who dug his heels in and in effect, cut off his nose to spite his face, she can succeed <em>despite,</em> and not because of, her education. </p>



<p>What matters is that she has at least one parent who has taken the time and loves her enough to override any ego needs they may have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A dispassionate person would try to be such a parent. Alas, Ed has proven himself unable or unwilling to do so. It is up to you to give what every good parent tries to give — enough respect for Monica so she feels listened to and appreciated for who she is (and not for what a parent insists he can mold her to be). What matters is that you decide whether remaining merely a peacekeeper is enough, or whether you should take a deep breath, bite the bullet, and face any wrath Ed may show simply because you have, once again, decided to be the kind of parent Monica needs. If you don’t take up the cudgels for her, Ed certainly won’t.</p>



<p>I know it is scary, SSWM, but some things are worth facing paper tigers for, don’t you think? And just in case you wonder whether this truly matters, perhaps the fact that you remember, despite the 45 years that have passed, how Ed-like your father was, may give you room for pause.   </p>



<p>Wishing you the best of luck,<br>MG Holmes</p>

Jeremy has a master's degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in three continents, he has been training with Dr. Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives .       Together, they have written two books:  Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality  and  Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons.             Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer:          I had a brother three years younger than me. When it was time for him to go to     college, all he wanted was to go to UP, but my father insisted that he go to DLSU     instead. My father was worried UP might make him a communist or a frat boy.          My brother, who had exceptional grades and was admired for being the     brightest student in his grade and high schools, was probably bored at La Salle, because he was always getting into trouble. The last straw was when he had an     argument with his teacher and, when it was obvious he was right, the teacher     threw an eraser at him, which he promptly threw back at the teacher. For     that he was expelled.          My brother never stopped resenting my father for what he (and I) saw as     my father's rigid view of education and lack of trust in my brother's ability to     make correct choices. Things were never the same between them after this. My     brother's chances for a good college education were also deeply affected by his     expulsion from DLSU. My father then moved heaven and earth to enroll him in     UP, but by then my brother said it was ""too little, too late.""          Fast forward to now, 45 years later. My daughter has also been called ""genius     material"" by her high school professors. She, too, wants to go to UP. Her father is     adamant she goes to a ""good Catholic school"" like Ateneo, DLSU, UST. My     daughter is heartbroken about his decision and begged me to intervene.           I usually don't like to do that as it makes my husband very angry. But I do     not want a repeat of my brother's story. Please help.           SAD SISTER and WORRIED MOM             Dear SAD SISTER and WORRIED MOM (SSWM),      While your father is simply one of many who thought (still think?) that a Catholic college is a safer prospect than UP, his failure to nurture his own son's talent and potential was a tragic misstep from which there was apparently no redemption. As for your brother, his contribution seems to be to have acted out of sheer pique, thus emulating the immaturity and petulance shown by his DLSU professor.      One generation later, history is repeating itself, possibly in a case of intergenerational trauma ( for background see this, for example ). Another narrow-minded father is following his own prejudices and ignoring the best interests of his child.       Meanwhile you are caught in the middle, having to choose between supporting your daughter's efforts to go to UP and thus incurring the ire of your husband, or maintaining good relations with your husband and condemning your daughter to an arguably inferior education (I must confess to possible bias here - I am not a fan of Catholic educational establishments, having been an ""inmate"" at one, and my wife is a UP alumna and former UP professor).      So what to do, SSWM?      You have chosen a husband with striking similarities to your own father: dictatorial, convinced of his own infallibility, unwilling to brook dissent, and no great believer that marriage involves open communication between equals or that the aim of parenthood is to unleash the full potential of one's children.      Even if it might be an exercise in futility, you should try to reason with him dispassionately, arguing that your daughter's wishes should be taken seriously since she is her own person and should be entitled to her own autonomy (within certain limits perhaps). The arguments for and against UP should be fully discussed and perhaps there is room to allay some, if not all, of your husband's concerns.      The aim after all is to support your daughter's journey to full adulthood and independence by allowing her increasingly to make her own life choices. Love for one's children should not be expressed by punitive actions or insistence that parental aspirations should take precedence. Your daughter is after all her own distinct and separate person.      Should your husband prove obdurate however, then the harsh realities of life and the state of your marriage will apply. You will have to decide whether you have the will and/or the means to test the limits of your relationship and resist his unilateral efforts to impose his world view on the rest of his family.       Best wishes, JAF Baer                       Must Read                          [Two Pronged] Differing parenting styles                                                                                         Dear SSWM:      Thank you very much for your letter. I agree with everything Mr. Baer has written, except for the first statement in the penultimate paragraph, which includes the suggestion that you ""try to reason with (your husband) dispassionately.""      I am fairly sure you, as all young brides do, have tried to convince your husband (let's call him Ed) in the past. This is part and parcel of marriage, after all. However, I am also fairly sure that you discovered early on that Ed is not a dispassionate man.  This is why you ""usually don't like to do that (intervene) as it makes my husband very angry.""      Up until now, your decision to let Ed have his way (or let Ed  think  he is getting his own way) has worked well in your marriage.        Your daughter (let's call her Monica) wants to go to UP; Ed insists she go somewhere else. What is at stake here is not the actual school Monica goes to - a genius who applies herself will succeed no matter how limited and ""Katoliko cerrado"" (hence narrow in perspective) the approach of the university she goes to. As long as she behaves differently from her uncle who dug his heels in and in effect, cut off his nose to spite his face, she can succeed  despite,  and not because of, her education.       What matters is that she has at least one parent who has taken the time and loves her enough to override any ego needs they may have.       A dispassionate person would try to be such a parent. Alas, Ed has proven himself unable or unwilling to do so. It is up to you to give what every good parent tries to give -- enough respect for Monica so she feels listened to and appreciated for who she is (and not for what a parent insists he can mold her to be). What matters is that you decide whether remaining merely a peacekeeper is enough, or whether you should take a deep breath, bite the bullet, and face any wrath Ed may show simply because you have, once again, decided to be the kind of parent Monica needs. If you don't take up the cudgels for her, Ed certainly won't.      I know it is scary, SSWM, but some things are worth facing paper tigers for, don't you think? And just in case you wonder whether this truly matters, perhaps the fact that you remember, despite the 45 years that have passed, how Ed-like your father was, may give you room for pause.         Wishing you the best of luck, MG Holmes       - Rappler.com        Please send any comments, questions, or requests for advice to  twopronged@rappler.com .   ",Neutral
2600324,opinion-development-delay-reflections-being-new-mother,[OPINION] Development in the delay: Reflections on being a new mother,"
<p>Many would agree that being a pandemic baby is difficult, but much also has to be said about how equally challenging it is to be a pandemic parent. Case in point: I had my daughter in 2021, at 30 years old, at a time when COVID vaccines were not yet available to the public, and when everything I ever thought would happen in childbirth did not happen. </p>



<p>For one, it was impossible then to have my husband beside me; instead, I was in a room of PPE-clad health professionals, total strangers witnessing my life’s most momentous occasion after a 21-hour ordeal of “Will we cut her open, or will we not?” (They ended up cutting me open.) I also wanted to see my baby and hold her as soon as she came out; instead, I passed out, resorting to viewing photos hours after, thanks to the kind anesthesiologist who sought my permission to take my phone right before the procedure. Lastly, they asked me what I had wanted to hear in the delivery room; I requested Yo-Yo Ma and his cello, but they played Boyce Avenue covers instead. Indeed, <em>a woman can’t have it all.</em></p>



<p>I named my daughter Hiraya: a name that already came up in Messenger conversations years before she was even conceived, between me and my then-boyfriend, now husband and father of my child. We already knew deep in our hearts that this was <em>the </em>name we wanted for the child we wanted to have in the <em>far, far future</em>. Sources say that her name is in archaic Filipino, which translates to, “fruition of our heart’s deepest desires.” Her dad and I were also no strangers to a popular TV show which also has her name; it says, “May your wishes be granted!” And she did <em>exactly </em>that.</p>



<p>Being mother to Hiraya has changed me in ways I did not think possible. For one, the pregnancy came as a surprise. I had ambivalence towards being a mother, having claimed that I was okay not to have a child. Having Hiraya was the Universe’s way of telling me that it was a lie and perhaps I was, indeed, meant to be a mother. While motherhood did not come to me naturally right away – especially in the first few weeks of dealing with breastfeeding (Really? It wasn’t just a matter of sticking it out and giving it to my baby?), postpartum blues, nursing my own Cesarean wounds while nursing and rocking my daughter to sleep, and coping with the help of BTS songs and videos – I have learned to embrace it. </p>

<p>Sometimes I sit with it to talk with it and understand its challenges. I had to fight for who I was – or whoever I thought I was – while also embracing the new reality of being responsible for another human being. I had to accept this new person born out of the person for whom I gave birth – organs displaced and then rearranged to give way to something bigger than myself.</p>



<p>Clearly, neither playbook nor my diplomas could have prepared me for the sheer amount of courage and love I had overnight. I was floored with all the love I suddenly could muster – especially as one who almost always just thought about herself. I also found myself capable of carrying a heavy mental load both at home and at work. Everything I did, in one form or another, became related to her and was made possible <em>because </em>of her: promotions, a new home, and the audacity to have big, big dreams. I made sure to check developmental checklists. I made sure her vaccinations were on time. I made sure she had enough ground to cover as she learned how to walk. I did what I could within my capacity. That said, it can be taxing, but as I read somewhere, “Parenting is hard for the good ones.”</p>



<p>It helps that motherhood in the 21st century has its own set of unique perks. There are a plethora of support pages. On Instagram, there are accounts solely devoted to helping mothers realize that they are not alone and they are not being bad mothers for feeling depleted and delighted at the same time. As I learn to be a mother without my own mother, I can only look back on how it was for me and my Mama; not once did I hear her complain. I did grow up in the &#8217;90s though, rife with its baby commercials that perhaps might have given me the wrong impression that it was <em>easy </em>and <em>peaceful, </em>filled with background music of some angelic nursery rhyme&#8217;s orchestral version. As I discover, it is far from that – as it is demanding, noisy, and messy – but never have I felt this kind of fulfillment, too. I dare say that motherhood also made me a better person, a better leader, and a better partner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With its many iterations, I have also learned that no form of motherhood is better than the other; no one is easier than the other. It may sound condescending – coming from me, a working mother – but I know it in my heart to be true, holding all mothers in high regard. I know how it is like to wrestle with contradictions and guilt as we long for a semblance of normalcy in the everyday. There are mothers more skilled than I am who are at home, while there are mothers like me working so hard while wishing for more time with their sons and daughters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On another important note, today exists the widely contested version of motherhood, with its extended babysitter: The Screen. Parents nowadays are divided with regard to its use, while parents then only had the good old TV with no Cocomelons and Teacher Rachels. We know it: more health professionals have started to correlate the impact of screen time on children’s development. We also know it: being parents is hard enough; we should not judge what others decide to do. The Screen, at least for us, turned out to be a flaw.</p>



<p>In January this year – a few months away from her third birthday – my husband and I had to receive the difficult news that my daughter has Global Developmental Delay. While she is adept in many areas of development (cognitive, adaptive), there are gaps in her speech development. There are also behavioral challenges, such as stranger anxiety, that we had to address.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I found myself booking appointments with an inclusive preschool, an occupational therapist, and a speech therapist. We had to rethink our routines at home. The iPad had to be dead, and tantrums we thought long gone were resurrected. And just like when she was born, new forms of guilt and self-doubt engulfed me as I still tried to hold on to silver linings. I questioned myself if I was responsible for the delay, even if I knew all other related factors. I regretted all the times I gave her a screen just to have a few more minutes of sleep. Did I do this to my child? Should I have stayed at home? There were so many decisions I replayed in my head and for a while, in the midst of frantic search for resources and answers, I still could not be initially consoled by testimonies and pieces of evidence that the interventions <em>do</em> work. Even the developmental pediatrician told us, “Good job <em>kayo</em>&#8221; for having the initiative to have her. Did we, really?</p>

<p>It is good that everything I have shared above – in this essay of motherhood I will continue to write through life – gives me grace to be kind to myself. I have done what I can and I will continue to do what I can, considering I have the best support system. That said, I think of all the mothers who may want to get help, but do not know where to start. I think of all the mothers who had to give up something for their child. I think of all the mothers with no support systems. I think of all the mothers who are raising their child on their own. Without invalidating my own struggles, I think of all the mothers who may have even bigger struggles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because while this era may have its perks, it is also hard to be a parent in a day and age when comparison is too easy due to social media and when there is too much information to digest. It seems so easy for others to take what one said differently or take a quick peek at your feed and feel like they know you even when they don’t. You work – you are questioned; you stay at home – you are questioned. You gain weight – they say you’ve failed to take care of yourself, even as you face the gargantuan task of parenting. I think there is so much more the world can do beyond these erroneous and harsh assumptions; there is so much kindness and strength it needs, especially from mothers who know how to empower others.</p>



<p>For now, what I do know is that there might be some delay in my daughters’ skills, but in the delay, there is a lot of development. I find myself more conscious about how I spend my time with her, given the limited period of time outside work hours and during weekends. I find my husband and I communicating more with each other regarding how best to support our daughter. I find myself more aware, more empathetic, and more open towards the plight of others, especially those whom I might have dismissed so easily when I did not know any better. I find myself less judgmental and more discerning, less impulsive and more patient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of this delay, we are being developed into even better, more compassionate versions of ourselves; we get to pause and reflect on what is most essential. See, my daughter did <em>that </em>– and I know she can do so much more as we catch up and equip her with the best possible care we can give. And while I may not really have it all, it’s okay, for my daughter has given me so much more.&nbsp;<strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

Must Read                          [OPINION] The myth of self-sacrifice: How I was taught about motherhood as a young girl                                                                                         It is good that everything I have shared above - in this essay of motherhood I will continue to write through life - gives me grace to be kind to myself. I have done what I can and I will continue to do what I can, considering I have the best support system. That said, I think of all the mothers who may want to get help, but do not know where to start. I think of all the mothers who had to give up something for their child. I think of all the mothers with no support systems. I think of all the mothers who are raising their child on their own. Without invalidating my own struggles, I think of all the mothers who may have even bigger struggles.       Because while this era may have its perks, it is also hard to be a parent in a day and age when comparison is too easy due to social media and when there is too much information to digest. It seems so easy for others to take what one said differently or take a quick peek at your feed and feel like they know you even when they don't. You work - you are questioned; you stay at home - you are questioned. You gain weight - they say you've failed to take care of yourself, even as you face the gargantuan task of parenting. I think there is so much more the world can do beyond these erroneous and harsh assumptions; there is so much kindness and strength it needs, especially from mothers who know how to empower others.      For now, what I do know is that there might be some delay in my daughters' skills, but in the delay, there is a lot of development. I find myself more conscious about how I spend my time with her, given the limited period of time outside work hours and during weekends. I find my husband and I communicating more with each other regarding how best to support our daughter. I find myself more aware, more empathetic, and more open towards the plight of others, especially those whom I might have dismissed so easily when I did not know any better. I find myself less judgmental and more discerning, less impulsive and more patient.       Because of this delay, we are being developed into even better, more compassionate versions of ourselves; we get to pause and reflect on what is most essential. See, my daughter did  that  - and I know she can do so much more as we catch up and equip her with the best possible care we can give. And while I may not really have it all, it's okay, for my daughter has given me so much more.  - Rappler.com        Ryza Martinez-Solana, 33, is a senior manager and school-based administrator for PHINMA Education, a network of schools in the Philippines and in Indonesia.

<p>CEBU, Philippines – For more than seven decades, Filipino-Chinese businesswoman Bonifacia Go wakes up at around 5 in the morning to burn incense by her family’s home altar in Cebu City.</p>



<p>It is a humble altar, populated by four incense burners, a portrait of a loved one and statuettes of religious and spiritual figures.</p>



<p>These figures range from images of the Santo Niño (Child Jesus) and the Blessed Virgin Mary to Buddha and <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/science/society-culture/what-the-world-can-learn-from-the-buddhist-concept-loving-kindness/"">bodhisattvas</a> (practitioners of “enlightenment”) like Guanyin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go, who is now 76, begins her morning ritual by lighting a stick and whispering a short prayer to the Buddha. Then, another stick and prayer for the Santo Niño, and the same for her departed ones.</p>



<p>In her younger days, Go would be accompanied by her 13 siblings and parents who raised them to value the ritual passed down from generation to generation. </p>



<p>“My father would go back to Qianmen in China every now and then, but when he comes to our home in Cebu, we make sure to pray to Buddha and Santo Niño together,” Go said.</p>



<p>Go’s family, of course, is not the only one to practice faith this way. </p>



<p>In Cebu’s downtown area, many stores owned by prominent Filipino-Chinese families, also maintain an altar composed of incense burners or food offerings and images of the Santo Niño and Buddha (sometimes substituted with the Budai or “Laughing Buddha”).</p>

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-china-to-cebu"">China to Cebu</h5>



<p>Prior to the start of the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/ispeak/96830-forgotten-history-polistas-galleon-trade/"">Manila Galleon Trade</a> in 1565 and even the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/242957-celebrating-500-years-christianity-philippines/"">introduction of Christianity</a> to the Philippines in 1521, historical documents and artifacts in the form of excavated Chinese ceramics have suggested the existence of commercial and cultural exchanges between Chinese merchants and Cebu’s ancestors.</p>



<p>According to Vinch Layon, a coordinator of the Sugbu Chinese Heritage Museum, the spur of Chinese immigration to Cebu can be traced back to the 1860s, a time when international trade flourished.</p>



<p>“When they arrived here, they sold scraps and did odd jobs. Some of them prospered and started a retail business, hardware business, shipping business…,” Layon told Rappler on Friday, February 9.</p>



<p>Among the many travelers who settled in Cebu was Don Pedro Singson Gotiaoco, whose descendants like <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/244577-how-john-gokongwei-jr-built-empire-selling-peanuts/"">Manuel Gotianuy</a> and <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/12054-being-john-gokongwei/?cx_testId=2&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_1&amp;cx_artPos=1&amp;cx_experienceId=EX4CPN0G1RJL&amp;cxTrackingId=%7Bkpdx%7DAAAAp2bpTfTxawoKQ1M3cWxqeHdwahIQbHNldWJsZzNlb3RsZ3EyZBoMRVg0Q1BOMEcxUkpMIiUxODdqcXIwMDk0LTAwMDAzM2NlanN0ODdlcDdvNW81c2xxNnQ0KiFzaG93UmVjb21tZW5kYXRpb25zSlFGUVlQVFI4NE9QMjJSEnYtbADwGXNiMWU3Z2NobzJlWgwxMTkuOTIuNzIuMTJiA2R3Y2igvp6uBnAJeBg#cxrecs_s"">John Gokongwei Jr.</a> are known for their ventures in the fields of finance, real estate, and enterprise.</p>



<p>“From only six recorded Chinese residents in Cebu in 1830, the number rose to thirty in 1857, 611 in 1870, 1,032 in 1885, and 1,503 in 1893,” reads an excerpt from Filipino historian Resil Mojares’ <em>The Book of Go</em>.</p>



<p>The growing population, according to Mojares, had found home in a district called the <em>“Lutao”</em>, consisting of small stores and lodging along Manuel Cabahug Briones Street, Magallanes Street, Carbon Market, and the Freedom Park in Cebu City.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Differences in worship</strong></h5>



<p>Buddhism had been around in China since the beginning of the Han Dynasty in the first century. It was only in the late 16th century that Jesuit missionaries arrived in the country to spread Christianity.&nbsp; </p>



<p>“(Buddhism) was something that the Catholic Church did not initially understand until a Jesuit priest by the name of Matteo Ricci went to China and found that their worship of the ancestors was completely different from the worship of God,” Jaime Sy of the 1730 Jesuit House told Rappler.</p>



<p>Sy explained that Buddhism is a “humanistic religion” that prioritizes enlightenment over the concept of a creator or a higher being. He added that even the Buddha did not claim to be a deity or god.</p>



<p>However, during the Spanish colonial period, non-Christian practices like the burning of incense in veneration of ancestors closely linked to Buddhism was heavily frowned upon.</p>



<p>“Spanish missionaries often complained about the sincerity of Chinese converts, pointing out the numerous times when the latter continued to practice non-Christian rituals after conversion,” says an excerpt from Richard Chu and Teresita See’s <em>Toward a History of Chinese Burial Grounds in Manila during the Spanish Colonial Period</em>. </p>



<p>Despite this, Chinese converts persisted in using traditional rituals and adopted Catholic methods of worship through the years. Soon Filipino-Chinese families in Cebu began participating in the annual <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/visayas/cebu-fiesta-senor-walk-devotion-purpose-january-11-2024/"">Fiesta Señor</a> dedicated to the Santo Niño or the Child Jesus.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Two birds, one home</strong></h5>



<p>While Buddhism, specifically Han Buddhism, is the <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2023/08/30/buddhism/#:~:text=Han%20Buddhists%20generally%20espouse%20the,well%2Dbeing%20of%20deceased%20ancestors.&amp;text=They%20also%20have%20incorporated%20the%20Taoist%20practice%20of%20breathing%20exercises."" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">largest officially recognized religion</a> in China, the blending of religious beliefs and traditional practices is particularly common among Chinese citizens, according to the Pew Research Center.</p>



<p>For Jose Mateo, a Filipino-Chinese member of the Buddha&#8217;s Light International Association-Philippines and a devout Christian in Cebu, Buddhism is not a practice to replace existing beliefs.</p>



<p>The Buddhist-Christian explained that the teachings of Buddha are inclusive and grounded on steps that people must follow to enhance their life.</p>



<p>The same steps can be found in different versions of Buddhist schools or philosophies and in Buddhist discourse like the <a href=""https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/khp/khp.9.amar.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">&#8220;Karaniya Metta Sutta&#8221;</a>:</p>



<pre class=""wp-block-verse""><em>This is what should be done
	By one who is skilled in goodness,
And who knows the path of peace:
	Let them be able and upright,
Straightforward and gentle in speech,
	Humble and not conceited,
Contented and easily satisfied,
	Unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways.
Peaceful and calm and wise and skillful,
	Not proud or demanding in nature.
Let them not do the slightest thing
	That the wise would later reprove.</em></pre>



<p>If anything, Mateo said, basic Buddhist teachings can enhance a person’s religious experiences.</p>



<p>“Buddhism tends to only promote the three acts of goodness which is to think good thoughts, speak good words, and do good deeds,” Mateo told Rappler.</p>



<p>According to Mateo, Fo Guang Shan (Buddha’s Light Mountain) temples, like the Chu Un (Compassion and Gratitude) temple of Cebu, have opened more English-speaking chapters to accommodate fellow Christians in the path of enlightenment.</p>

<p>MANILA, Philippines – Before the <a href=""https://www.oecd.org/publication/pisa-2022-results/country-notes/philippines-a0882a2d/#chapter-d1e11"">Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022</a>&nbsp;rankings were released in December 2023, the Department of Education (DepEd) had already said it was not expecting &#8220;good results.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seemed to be the agency&#8217;s way of controlling the narrative and minimizing public backlash, if not lowering public expectations. After all, the DepEd had already faced a string of controversies in only two years of Vice President Sara Duterte&#8217;s leadership. Critics hit Duterte for what they called &#8220;misplaced priorities&#8221; in the department – from red-tagging to alleged misuse of hefty confidential funds. </p>

</ul>



<p>“To be honest, we’re not expecting good results. So right now, we&#8217;re really focused in learning recovery. And that is why we requested that if there were realignments to be made, it should be realigned to the NLRP (National Learning Recovery Program),&#8221; DepEd Undersecretary Michael Poa said in <a href=""https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2023/11/12/2310914/deped-not-expecting-good-results-pisa-2022"">November 2023</a>. </p>



<p>Poa was right. The Philippines, once again, ended up among the countries that produced the lowest proficiency for 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science, as indicated by the PISA rankings. The country ranked 77th out of 81 countries globally.</p>



<p>The country scored Level 1a to 1b on mathematics, reading, and science. This means that students had below minimum proficiency in all three subject areas.</p>

<p>The latest PISA result begs the question: why do Filipino students continue to lag behind other countries in global education assessments?</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-just-memorization"">Just &#8216;memorization&#8217;</h5>



<p>At a Senate hearing on the 2022 PISA results on Wednesday, February 7, Senator Nancy Binay asked the DepEd if the questions in PISA were taught in schools in the country.<em> &#8220;Paano maisasagot ng mga student ang questions kung hindi siya naituturo as part of the curriculum</em>?&#8221; (How can the students answer the questions when these are not being taught as part of the curriculum?)</p>



<p>In response, educational psychologist and University of the Philippines professor Lizamarie Olegario said that the learning curriculum in the country is too much focused on mere &#8220;memorization&#8221; or the low ordering thinking skill, while PISA questions require analytical thinking. </p>



<p><em>&#8220;Hindi talaga siya natuturo sa classrooms natin. &#8216;Yung mga questions sa PISA ay practical real-life situations. Kasi dapat &#8216;yung tinuturo natin ay solving real-life problems, authentic learning dapat tayo,&#8221; </em>she explained. </p>



<p>(They are really not being taught in our classrooms. The questions in PISA were practical real-life situations. Because what we should be teaching them are about solving real-life problems. We should teach them about authentic learning.)</p>



<p>Olegario said that teachers should veer away from telling students to just memorize math formulas and read fictional books. &#8220;In reading, students are so much exposed to fiction. In math, more on memorizing formulas. But in PISA, they need to analyze problems. In science, basically the experiments only ask them to follow steps. But in PISA, they have to imagine. They have to do experiments in their minds.&#8221;</p>



<p>Olegario also attributed the dismal performance of students to the failed implementation of the K to 12 program. &#8220;The K to 12 is not being implemented to the fullest. The task performance is still on the lower order of thinking skills [which] should be the application side or problem solving.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even before K to 12 was launched in 2012, many were already clamoring against the additional two years of basic education. Despite a classroom shortage, lack of textbooks, tables and chairs, the ambitious program was implemented. Policymakers and proponents of K to 12 marketed it to the public as a curriculum preparing “graduates for tertiary education, middle-level skills development, employment, and entrepreneurship.”</p>



<p>But former DepEd director for curriculum and development Joyce Andaya refuted Olegario&#8217;s claim. She said that &#8220;nowhere in the review did it come out that we focused on the lower level thinking skills.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;In fact, in the review, there were very important findings. Number 1, there were overlapping. Number 2, there were misplaced competencies that should have been in grade 4 but perhaps in grade 7, and cognitive demands. There&#8217;s also high cognitive demands, meaning the curriculum has leaned towards high level than low thinking skills,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>But what Andaya failed to point out was whether the teachers were teaching the way lessons should be taught. The DepEd is the biggest employer of teachers having some 900,000 teaching personnel across the country. </p>



<p>&#8220;From our initial discussions, we just found out that our learners and teachers are not familiar with the type of tests that are given by PISA,&#8221; Andaya said. She said that there&#8217;s need to strengthen &#8220;formative tests&#8221; in classrooms to match the PISA questions. </p>



<p>In an interview with Rappler on Wednesday, Philippine Business for Education&#8217;s Justine Raagas said that there were two major factors why Filipino students lagged behind other countries in PISA. These are lack of resources and the quality of teachers the country has. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-lack-of-resources"">Lack of resources</h5>



<p>Raagas said that the Philippines is allotting only 3% to 4% of its gross domestic product for its education budget while the global standard is 6%. &#8220;We perform poor, and we spend less,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>For one, Raagas pointed out the perennial problem of classroom and textbook shortage. &#8220;We&#8217;re hounded by problems. We lack classrooms. Learners now still share textbooks.&#8221; </p>



<p>In 2023, the DepEd was able to build only 3,600 new classrooms. DepEd Assistant Secretary Francis Bringas said that Philippine public schools lacked some 159,000 classrooms before school opened in August 2023. At this rate, the government would be able to address the classroom shortage in 40 years, and by that time, more problems in the education sector would have come up. </p>



<p>Ironically, on the lack of textbooks, the DepEd left some P3 billion worth of learning materials sitting in warehouses from 2021 to 2023. A Rappler investigation revealed that the learning materials were held <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/deped-says-billions-worth-learning-materials-held-hostage/"">hostage</a> by logistics firm Transpac due to non-payment of fees, among other things. The materials were later released after Rappler published its report in December 2023.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-teacher-quality"">Teacher quality</h5>



<p>&#8220;Teachers are the biggest inputs to classroom learning. It’s important to have high quality teachers who are knowledgeable,&#8221; Raagas said, stressing the crucial role of teachers for some 28 million basic education students. </p>



<p>According to a <a href=""https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/351711468567066113/pdf/106950-REVISED-PH-PETS-QSDS-Note-3.pdf"">World Bank study in 2016</a>, the knowledge of teachers and the method they use to teach a subject were &#8220;important determinants of student learning outcomes in the Philippines.&#8221; The study showed that &#8220;knowledge of subject matter among elementary and high school teachers is low in most subjects.&#8221;</p>

<p>For instance, the World Bank study revealed that a mathematics teacher in high school was only able to answer 31% of the questions &#8220;completely correctly,&#8221; far from even half of the questions. </p>



<p>&#8220;Since the tests are closely aligned with the curriculum, the results suggest that teachers face significant challenges in teaching a considerable portion of the current K to 12 curriculum,&#8221; the study said. </p>



<p>How can students learn to analyze math equations if their teachers themselves are having a hard time answering them?</p>



<p>But Raagas said teachers shouldn&#8217;t be overburdened by the problems because they are overworked with administrative tasks rather than just teaching. &#8220;They need to be supported,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>To address this, the DepEd recently released an order removing administrative tasks from teachers so they could focus on teaching. Raagas, however, said that if the DepEd would hire only 5,000 administrative staff every year, it would take years for the agency to solve the problem. </p>



<p>&#8220;We have to remember that we have over 47,000 schools&#8230;. Do the math, if only 5,000 year-on-year, it would take years to be completed. In the next years, we would still have overworked teachers,&#8221; Raagas said.

<p>For years, teachers have complained that paperwork piling up hinders them from preparing lessons.</p>



<p>What does the DepEd need now? Raagas said the agency needs a strong leader. </p>



<p>&#8220;We need a strong leadership that [will say,] &#8216;hey all these things need to be done.&#8217; And the fact is that many of the reforms have to be done simultaneously,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>Many critics disagreed with Duterte&#8217;s appointment as education chief. She is not an educator, and some people questioned her qualifications. But the Vice President said her experience as a mother and her background in local governance are enough. Will she take the rest of her term to learn the job?<strong> – Rappler.com</strong></p>

It seemed to be the agency's way of controlling the narrative and minimizing public backlash, if not lowering public expectations. After all, the DepEd had already faced a string of controversies in only two years of Vice President Sara Duterte's leadership. Critics hit Duterte for what they called ""misplaced priorities"" in the department - from red-tagging to alleged misuse of hefty confidential funds.       ALSO ON RAPPLER         Sara Duterte brings red-tagging to DepEd        Why transfer of P125-M confidential funds to OVP sets dangerous precedent         ""To be honest, we're not expecting good results. So right now, we're really focused in learning recovery. And that is why we requested that if there were realignments to be made, it should be realigned to the NLRP (National Learning Recovery Program),"" DepEd Undersecretary Michael Poa said in  November 2023 .       Poa was right. The Philippines, once again, ended up among the countries that produced the lowest proficiency for 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science, as indicated by the PISA rankings. The country ranked 77th out of 81 countries globally.      The country scored Level 1a to 1b on mathematics, reading, and science. This means that students had below minimum proficiency in all three subject areas.             At level 1a for reading, students can understand only the literal meaning of sentences or short passages. At level 1b for mathematics, they can perform only simple calculations. Lastly, at level 1a for science, they can recognize only simple scientific phenomena.              The latest PISA result begs the question: why do Filipino students continue to lag behind other countries in global education assessments?      Just ‘memorization'      At a Senate hearing on the 2022 PISA results on Wednesday, February 7, Senator Nancy Binay asked the DepEd if the questions in PISA were taught in schools in the country.  ""Paano maisasagot ng mga student ang questions kung hindi siya naituturo as part of the curriculum ?"" (How can the students answer the questions when these are not being taught as part of the curriculum?)      In response, educational psychologist and University of the Philippines professor Lizamarie Olegario said that the learning curriculum in the country is too much focused on mere ""memorization"" or the low ordering thinking skill, while PISA questions require analytical thinking.        ""Hindi talaga siya natuturo sa classrooms natin. ‘Yung mga questions sa PISA ay practical real-life situations. Kasi dapat ‘yung tinuturo natin ay solving real-life problems, authentic learning dapat tayo,""  she explained.       (They are really not being taught in our classrooms. The questions in PISA were practical real-life situations. Because what we should be teaching them are about solving real-life problems. We should teach them about authentic learning.)      Olegario said that teachers should veer away from telling students to just memorize math formulas and read fictional books. ""In reading, students are so much exposed to fiction. In math, more on memorizing formulas. But in PISA, they need to analyze problems. In science, basically the experiments only ask them to follow steps. But in PISA, they have to imagine. They have to do experiments in their minds.""      Olegario also attributed the dismal performance of students to the failed implementation of the K to 12 program. ""The K to 12 is not being implemented to the fullest. The task performance is still on the lower order of thinking skills [which] should be the application side or problem solving.""      Even before K to 12 was launched in 2012, many were already clamoring against the additional two years of basic education. Despite a classroom shortage, lack of textbooks, tables and chairs, the ambitious program was implemented. Policymakers and proponents of K to 12 marketed it to the public as a curriculum preparing ""graduates for tertiary education, middle-level skills development, employment, and entrepreneurship.""      But former DepEd director for curriculum and development Joyce Andaya refuted Olegario's claim. She said that ""nowhere in the review did it come out that we focused on the lower level thinking skills.""       ""In fact, in the review, there were very important findings. Number 1, there were overlapping. Number 2, there were misplaced competencies that should have been in grade 4 but perhaps in grade 7, and cognitive demands. There's also high cognitive demands, meaning the curriculum has leaned towards high level than low thinking skills,"" she said.

<p>To commit a crime and get away with it, predators rely on a number of specific tools: one, that there are no witnesses; two, that in the chance they are caught in the act, there is nothing to trap them in place; and three, that they can sit on the shoulders of spineless enablers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The steady influx of encounters shared by victim-survivors prove that circumstances remain apt for predators despite enactments such as Republic Act No. 11313, better known as the Safe Spaces Act or the Bawal Bastos Law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its establishment in September 2022, youth organization Enough Is Enough has recorded at least 61 cases of incidents of harassment, abuse, and other forms of sexual violence from campuses all over the country since the Safe Spaces Act was passed five years ago. Even still, it is certain that there is an even greater number that remains unreported, and this continues to be the dominant narrative for victim-survivors everywhere, which is often a decision born out of a multitude of reasons, such as factors relating but not limited to lapses in legislation and the lack of accountability measures in our schools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these aforementioned legal and administrative obstacles are the most concrete and visible ones in the struggle, they persist because of an even larger withstanding issue, and this is the stigma and discrimination tied to those who have experiences of abuse and harassment. Beyond the weight of their traumatic encounters, they are often left to suffer in silence due to school administrations, churches, and even family members who do not understand their plight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All too often, a victim-survivor does not receive the support needed from all the ends through which they seek justice. For instance, they may resort to exposing their harasser on social media as a sort of recourse before they are contacted by school heads who fear their reputation at stake, requesting that the report “undergo proper channels,” when their first course of action is not an impulse but a reaction to what they understand is the most plausible and accessible form of justice they can receive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another example is a victim-survivor making the choice to go through the challenge of filing a case against their abuser, and running into a wall when they are discouraged by their own family and friends who would prefer “peace,” afraid of possible repercussions such as expulsion and cancellation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is clear that such responses to the affected person’s pursuit of justice only results in their added discomfort and distress, which likely ends in them withdrawing with a greater feeling of defeat in seeing how the odds seem to be stacked against them. In all these scenarios, the apparent pattern is that the victim-survivor is isolated, a recurring tactic employed to push them and their story into the margins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given that this is the face met by those who have experienced sexual violence, it is no wonder that there are more who have yet to come forward. When one is gaslit, censored, and intimidated by those in power, it is done with the intention of not only silencing one person, but also many others who decide for themselves that they do not wish to meet the same fate as their fellow victim-survivors before they even try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such is the survival of the patriarchal status quo. To sustain this system means to stomp on all attempts of justice because it needs to appear unattainable and perpetually out of reach, even more so for those who are on the lower end of power dynamics at play in various institutions, be it schools and workplaces, just to name a few. If stigma and discrimination are barriers that are already difficult to breach, the question of financial, legal, and psychosocial support is another that hangs over the heads of victim-survivors who cannot afford it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is why the campaign for genuine safe spaces must reject the myth of the individual narrative. For a victim-survivor to share their story takes courage, and it is courage that spreads to others with shared experiences. While effective legislation and proactive anti-violence mechanisms in our schools are certainly crucial, beyond them, these are the most striking and lasting wins in the long-term struggle, for it is the kind that cannot be extinguished by predators and enablers alike who are counting on fear in order to continue the cycle of impunity that keeps them around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These combined efforts generate collective action, the driving force towards a reality where safe spaces are a given for all, especially for the most vulnerable sectors of society. To participate in collective action means to turn the tides for everyone, because it is built not on token rules and regulations or the legal triumphs of a select few, but on the will and power of those in the movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To learn more and get involved, this Saturday, February 10, Enough Is Enough, in partnership with Partido Pandayan Organizing Committee, is holding a forum entitled Safer Spaces Now: Eradicating Campus Predators and Dismantling Enabling Institutions, with the aim of weaving&nbsp;all local struggles into a national and sectoral struggle. Those who wish to participate can reserve their slot via bit.ly/SaferSpacesForum.&nbsp;<strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

Even still, it is certain that there is an even greater number that remains unreported, and this continues to be the dominant narrative for victim-survivors everywhere, which is often a decision born out of a multitude of reasons, such as factors relating but not limited to lapses in legislation and the lack of accountability measures in our schools.       While these aforementioned legal and administrative obstacles are the most concrete and visible ones in the struggle, they persist because of an even larger withstanding issue, and this is the stigma and discrimination tied to those who have experiences of abuse and harassment. Beyond the weight of their traumatic encounters, they are often left to suffer in silence due to school administrations, churches, and even family members who do not understand their plight.                        From Our Archives                          Harassed students need more awareness, access to rights - lawyer                                                                                         All too often, a victim-survivor does not receive the support needed from all the ends through which they seek justice. For instance, they may resort to exposing their harasser on social media as a sort of recourse before they are contacted by school heads who fear their reputation at stake, requesting that the report ""undergo proper channels,"" when their first course of action is not an impulse but a reaction to what they understand is the most plausible and accessible form of justice they can receive.       Another example is a victim-survivor making the choice to go through the challenge of filing a case against their abuser, and running into a wall when they are discouraged by their own family and friends who would prefer ""peace,"" afraid of possible repercussions such as expulsion and cancellation.       It is clear that such responses to the affected person's pursuit of justice only results in their added discomfort and distress, which likely ends in them withdrawing with a greater feeling of defeat in seeing how the odds seem to be stacked against them. In all these scenarios, the apparent pattern is that the victim-survivor is isolated, a recurring tactic employed to push them and their story into the margins.       Given that this is the face met by those who have experienced sexual violence, it is no wonder that there are more who have yet to come forward. When one is gaslit, censored, and intimidated by those in power, it is done with the intention of not only silencing one person, but also many others who decide for themselves that they do not wish to meet the same fate as their fellow victim-survivors before they even try.       Such is the survival of the patriarchal status quo. To sustain this system means to stomp on all attempts of justice because it needs to appear unattainable and perpetually out of reach, even more so for those who are on the lower end of power dynamics at play in various institutions, be it schools and workplaces, just to name a few. If stigma and discrimination are barriers that are already difficult to breach, the question of financial, legal, and psychosocial support is another that hangs over the heads of victim-survivors who cannot afford it.                    Play  Video                     This is why the campaign for genuine safe spaces must reject the myth of the individual narrative. For a victim-survivor to share their story takes courage, and it is courage that spreads to others with shared experiences. While effective legislation and proactive anti-violence mechanisms in our schools are certainly crucial, beyond them, these are the most striking and lasting wins in the long-term struggle, for it is the kind that cannot be extinguished by predators and enablers alike who are counting on fear in order to continue the cycle of impunity that keeps them around.       These combined efforts generate collective action, the driving force towards a reality where safe spaces are a given for all, especially for the most vulnerable sectors of society. To participate in collective action means to turn the tides for everyone, because it is built not on token rules and regulations or the legal triumphs of a select few, but on the will and power of those in the movement.       To learn more and get involved, this Saturday, February 10, Enough Is Enough, in partnership with Partido Pandayan Organizing Committee, is holding a forum entitled Safer Spaces Now: Eradicating Campus Predators and Dismantling Enabling Institutions, with the aim of weaving all local struggles into a national and sectoral struggle. Those who wish to participate can reserve their slot via bit.ly/SaferSpacesForum.  - Rappler.com        Sophia Beatriz Reyes, lead convenor of Enough Is Enough, likes to spend time writing, sewing, and going on walks.

<p>The campaign started with training for teachers about environmental awareness so that they could guide students even beyond the campaign’s conclusion.

The school with the heaviest accumulated plastic waste was awarded a Knowledge TV.</p>



<p>Students were once again taught how to make eco planters and the student with the best planter will be awarded an Android tablet.</p>



<p>An Eco Garden competition was also in place, so students could apply what they learned from the classroom in a realistic setting. And the group with the most transformative and creative garden was also recognized.</p>



<p>Just in time for the holiday season too is the Eco Christmas Corner program where grade three students were taught how to use recyclable materials to decorate their Christmas Corners.</p>



<p>Now in its third year of the campaign, Breeze is living up to their promise of continued environmental education for young students.

2598206,opinion-rescuing-education-system-department,[OPINION] Rescuing the education system from the pits,"
<p>Rescuing the education system from the pit into which it has plummeted will doubtless require enabling legislation for curricular reforms, organizational changes, and fresh funds.&nbsp;EDCOM II analysis suggests, however, that the effectiveness of these measures will depend on addressing the persisting problem of misaligned assumptions, objectives, and expectations documented in its report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most obvious cases show inconsistency in compliance with the laws or the failure of offices within the same organization to coordinate efforts towards shared objectives. Misalignment occurs at multiple levels of the same institution, but also across independent agencies, among service providers and clients, and between private and public sectors. While it will take more time to distill the essence of the examples in the EDCOM II report, the dots it provides already connect to current concerns.</p>



<p>DepEd, for instance, hopes to get the support of the World Bank to determine&nbsp;“the basis and proper approach for a pay increase” for teachers that would include provisions for higher take-home pay, expanded health coverage, a calamity fund, as well as overload and overtime pay.</p>



<p>A sound suggestion, though hopefully, as recommended,&nbsp;not at the cost of taxpayers.&nbsp;EDCOM II had noted that DepEd’s estimated entry-level hiring cost for statisticians exceeded industry market rates, the kind of miscalculations external vetting would help avoid.</p>



<p>The study should include an analysis of the education market and the comparative performance of service providers.&nbsp;Already, DepEd teachers receive higher pay than their counterparts in the private sector. Is the public getting the expected benefits against actual expenditures, the proverbial bang for their buck? Does DepEd need a monthly entry-level rate of P50,000, the figure floated in media and almost double the current rate, to get effective teachers?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The value of financial incentives to motivate job performance is well-known.&nbsp;But pay increases, especially when distributed across the board to existing personnel, immediately result in a more expensive, not necessarily more effective, staff. If some parochial schools, generally already in distress, provide equal if not better-quality instruction, would it not make sense to transfer to them children out of overburdened public schools, which can then work on improving quality?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responding to an EDCOM II related concern,&nbsp;DepEd wants to focus on education effectiveness by relieving teachers of&nbsp;non-teaching assignments, such as managing school events or facilities, providing periodic reports to higher authorities, and conducting census or assessment tests.&nbsp;The burden of such obligations and their compensation do not match the prescriptions mandated by the 1966 Magna Carta for Public School Teachers, as EDCOM I already noted in 1994.&nbsp;Additional “ancillary and administrative” duties routinely violate the rules limiting daily teacher working assignment&nbsp;to eight hours, six in the classroom and two for supporting activities.</p>



<p>DepEd’s proposed solution would involve hiring additional people for temporary appointments outside the regular plantilla and paid&nbsp;from the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) budget.&nbsp;The approach is permitted but problematic.&nbsp;DepEd has identified some 50 extra-curricular obligations imposed on teachers, perhaps not even including all of the activities organized by local government units.&nbsp;Whatever relief the staff will get is likely to be as temporary as the source of funding, a suspicion skeptics within the department have already expressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither will the measure relieve for long the pressure on DepEd’s budget, the bulk of which supports personnel services.&nbsp;A 2016 World Bank study concluded that “existing levels of school MOOE do not cover the full operating costs of public elementary and high schools.”&nbsp;EDCOM II expects the thrust towards online education to raise the cost of utility bills, already consuming 30-70% of MOOE, leaving little for&nbsp;other learning needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The recourse to non-tenured, contractual help for recurring extra-curricular duties funded by MOOE cannot serve as a long-term solution.&nbsp;It is likely instead to feed the natural appetite of bureaucracies to grow. The new recruits become a ready-made lobby group, enlisting populist politicians and paid lawyers to argue that they fulfill necessary services, which entitle them to permanent appointments.&nbsp;As long as the status of regular employees remain secure, they risk little resistance from the established bureaucracy, which gains with growing numbers greater political influence.</p>



<p>Growth can be functional and healthy.&nbsp;But the logic of EDCOM II’s analysis would caution against presuming that the laudable goal of focusing teachers on effective classroom instruction require the expansion of the bureaucracy.&nbsp;A prior step would determine which extra-curricular tasks contribute to DepEd’s mission.&nbsp;Which of the reports filed by teachers are actually read and acted upon and produce meaningful results?</p>

",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-rescuing-education-system-department/,2024-02-06T12:02:58,2024-02-06T12:03:04,"[16490, 758, 755]",[OPINION] Rescuing the education system from the pits,"  Rescuing the education system from the pit into which it has plummeted will doubtless require enabling legislation for curricular reforms, organizational changes, and fresh funds. EDCOM II analysis suggests, however, that the effectiveness of these measures will depend on addressing the persisting problem of misaligned assumptions, objectives, and expectations documented in its report.        The most obvious cases show inconsistency in compliance with the laws or the failure of offices within the same organization to coordinate efforts towards shared objectives. Misalignment occurs at multiple levels of the same institution, but also across independent agencies, among service providers and clients, and between private and public sectors. While it will take more time to distill the essence of the examples in the EDCOM II report, the dots it provides already connect to current concerns.      DepEd, for instance, hopes to get the support of the World Bank to determine ""the basis and proper approach for a pay increase"" for teachers that would include provisions for higher take-home pay, expanded health coverage, a calamity fund, as well as overload and overtime pay.      A sound suggestion, though hopefully, as recommended, not at the cost of taxpayers. EDCOM II had noted that DepEd's estimated entry-level hiring cost for statisticians exceeded industry market rates, the kind of miscalculations external vetting would help avoid.      The study should include an analysis of the education market and the comparative performance of service providers. Already, DepEd teachers receive higher pay than their counterparts in the private sector. Is the public getting the expected benefits against actual expenditures, the proverbial bang for their buck? Does DepEd need a monthly entry-level rate of P50,000, the figure floated in media and almost double the current rate, to get effective teachers?                         Must Read                          Overtime pay, no admin tasks: Sara Duterte promises more benefits for teachers                                                                                         The value of financial incentives to motivate job performance is well-known. But pay increases, especially when distributed across the board to existing personnel, immediately result in a more expensive, not necessarily more effective, staff. If some parochial schools, generally already in distress, provide equal if not better-quality instruction, would it not make sense to transfer to them children out of overburdened public schools, which can then work on improving quality?       Responding to an EDCOM II related concern, DepEd wants to focus on education effectiveness by relieving teachers of non-teaching assignments, such as managing school events or facilities, providing periodic reports to higher authorities, and conducting census or assessment tests. The burden of such obligations and their compensation do not match the prescriptions mandated by the 1966 Magna Carta for Public School Teachers, as EDCOM I already noted in 1994. Additional ""ancillary and administrative"" duties routinely violate the rules limiting daily teacher working assignment to eight hours, six in the classroom and two for supporting activities.      DepEd's proposed solution would involve hiring additional people for temporary appointments outside the regular plantilla and paid from the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) budget. The approach is permitted but problematic. DepEd has identified some 50 extra-curricular obligations imposed on teachers, perhaps not even including all of the activities organized by local government units. Whatever relief the staff will get is likely to be as temporary as the source of funding, a suspicion skeptics within the department have already expressed.        Neither will the measure relieve for long the pressure on DepEd's budget, the bulk of which supports personnel services. A 2016 World Bank study concluded that ""existing levels of school MOOE do not cover the full operating costs of public elementary and high schools."" EDCOM II expects the thrust towards online education to raise the cost of utility bills, already consuming 30-70% of MOOE, leaving little for other learning needs.         The recourse to non-tenured, contractual help for recurring extra-curricular duties funded by MOOE cannot serve as a long-term solution. It is likely instead to feed the natural appetite of bureaucracies to grow. The new recruits become a ready-made lobby group, enlisting populist politicians and paid lawyers to argue that they fulfill necessary services, which entitle them to permanent appointments. As long as the status of regular employees remain secure, they risk little resistance from the established bureaucracy, which gains with growing numbers greater political influence.      Growth can be functional and healthy. But the logic of EDCOM II's analysis would caution against presuming that the laudable goal of focusing teachers on effective classroom instruction require the expansion of the bureaucracy. A prior step would determine which extra-curricular tasks contribute to DepEd's mission. Which of the reports filed by teachers are actually read and acted upon and produce meaningful results?                       Must Read                          What you need to know about DepEd's ‘Catch-up Fridays'                                                                                         Assessment tests not directly focused on classroom instruction are critical to the collection of comprehensive data for analysis and for maintaining system quality. These often fail because they are poorly planned, inadequately supported, and badly implemented, leading to dubious results made even less useful by delayed completion. Ironically, the sources contributing to failure stem not from lack but from excess of assessment activities of which EDCOM II has enumerated over 30.

<p>For the nth time, Greenhills Shopping Center (GSC) has again landed on the United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) <a href=""https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2023_Review_of_Notorious_Markets_for_Counterfeiting_and_Piracy_Notorious_Markets_List_final.pdf"">Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy</a> (Notorious Markets List). It is the lone physical market of the Philippines on the 2023 list. </p>



<p>GSC continues to sell counterfeit goods such as electronics, perfumes, watches, shoes, accessories, and other fashion items, according to the USTR’s latest report released on January 30, 2024. </p>



<p>Greenhills’ inclusion in the list again shows the weak rule of law in the Philippines. As the USTR said, “[Property] Rights holders report enforcement activity in the form of warning letters and subsequent suspension of business, but the targets of enforcement often evade such efforts by moving the location of their stalls.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But counterfeit products have ceased to be Greenhills&#8217; main attraction. Online shopping, anti-piracy drives, and technological changes have combined to substantially reduce the foot traffic in what was once the go-to place for shopping in Metro Manila. </p>



<p>If Greenhills wants to bring back life to what it says is the Philippines’ first shopping complex, it will have to work with the San Juan City government and other private establishments in drawing up a master plan. They will have to creative. </p>



<p>With more Filipinos traveling abroad and seeing what other countries have to offer in terms of shopping and entertainment, mall-goers expect unique experiences.&nbsp;They want Instagrammable spots that they can share with friends and families on social media. They want to taste food that aren&#8217;t available in the areas where they reside or work. They want to be enriched by history and culture. </p>



<p>As a longtime former resident of San Juan City, I am saddened by what&#8217;s become of Greenhills. Gone is the hustle and bustle of shoppers, the excitement in buying good finds. I have thus come up with some ideas on how to bring non-residents of the city back to Greenhills. Since San Juan is the smallest city in Metro Manila with 126,347 people, it has to attract the majority who do not live there. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-overhaul-greenhills-project"">Overhaul Greenhills Project</h5>



<p>But first, a quick summary of what&#8217;s been the official responses to the inclusion of Greenhills in USTR&#8217;s Notorious Markets List: </p>



<ul>
<li>On February 2, 2024, the Intellectual Property Rights of the Philippines (IPOPHL) said it continues to work with the National Committee on Intellectual Property Rights (NCIPR), which it chairs, in fulfilling the work plan Overhaul Greenhills Project (OG Project) to eliminate the stores selling counterfeit products.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Under the OG Project, the NCIPR was supposed to collaborate more with Greenhills “with hopes of compelling the shopping center to implement stricter monitoring of their stalls and impose heftier penalties against sellers of counterfeit products,” the IPOPHL said a year ago or in February 2023.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The year before, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between IPOPHL and the Philippine Retailers Association (PRA) on a code of conduct in the fight against piracy was signed on March 30. Since GSC is part of the PRA, it was thought that the MOU would “help stamp out counterfeit trade the the lone physical Philippine market still on the list.”</li>



<li>IPOPHL had also hoped that San Juan City would “fully enforce&#8221; the Intellectual Property Code of 1997 and the Department of the Interior and Local Government’s (DILG) IP-related issuances on anti-counterfeit and anti-piracy policies. </li>



<li>San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora vowed in 2023 that the city would strongly enforce the law by strictly monitoring the shopping center, but the sale of counterfeit products continued.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>“Truly, clearing Greenhills of IP infringement activities will not be an easy feat. Its long-standing reputation as a market for Class As and Bs and pirated DVDs has cut across generations. The problem demands the close and consistent collaboration among NCIPR members, local governments, brand owners and Greenhills – both its managers and vendors. Equally important is the role of consumers whom we continuously enlighten about the possible harms of counterfeiting to their health, lives and households, as well as to the environment and the economy in the bigger picture and longer term,” IPOPHL Director-General Rowel Barba said in last year’s press release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Greenhills management’s long-term tack in finally putting an end to piracy in the shopping complex is the development of a new mall, which had a soft opening of its East Wing last October in time for Christmas.&nbsp;Under Greenhills management’s plan, it will no longer allow the vendors who sell counterfeit goods in its new mall. Only the traders who sell pearls in <em>tiangges</em> and those selling genuine clothing and fashion items will be accommodated.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In response to this, USTR said in its 2023 report that companies whose property rights have been violated “need to wait and see the results.”&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-ecommerce-and-piracy"">Ecommerce and piracy </h5>



<p>Greenhills is no longer a shopping mecca. In its heyday, it used to get as many as 80,000 shoppers on weekdays and 100,000 to 120,000 on weekends. </p>



<p>Online shopping is probably the biggest factor behind Greenhills’ decline as a bargain shopping center with unique finds. With no rent to pay (and no taxes and permits for many), those selling on ecommerce sites can sell goods at lower prices than the shops in Greenhills.&nbsp;For instance, mobile phones, among the hottest items bought in Greenhills years ago, are generally cheaper online than in physical stores. </p>



<p>Advances in technology have also killed piracy. Streaming platforms have made DVDs obsolete. Fake DVDs are now found mainly in <em>palengkes</em> (wet and dry markets), no longer in malls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Game developers have also been able to stop the illegal copying of games, a service which was available in Greenhills two to three decades ago. </p>



<p>I lived in San Juan for over two decades when it was still a town of Metro Manila. For many years, especially in the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s, shoppers filled its <em>tiangge</em> area, Virra Mall, Shoppesville, especially during Christmas, which had around 2,000 shops. Many micro and small entrepreneurs were made rich by Greenhills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For some of the residents of San Juan who lived nearby, traffic got so bad that it was faster to walk to the place. Parking was always difficult, and the roads surrounding Greenhills Shopping Center would be lined up with cars parked on the streets. Shops closed not earlier than 10 pm during the Yuletide season. </p>



<p>When I visited Greenhills Shopping Center last December in what was supposed to be its peak month, parking was a breeze, what with its new multi-level parking buildings in front, and the multi-level parking on top of Unimart grocery. </p>

<p>Ortigas Land had a soft opening of the new East Wing of what it now calls GH Mall last November, and there was hardly any buzz about it. Except for a few unique ones, the tenants in GH Mall can also be found in other malls in the capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Greenhills will be moving its pearl market and the other <em>tiangges</em> to this new wing. Five levels of the mall will be the new areas for the 2,000 <em>tiangge</em> stalls of the shopping complex. </p>



<p>“The&nbsp;<em>tiangge</em>&nbsp;will be a section in the mall. It will be more organized but still be a bargain shopping haven,” then-Ortigas &amp; Company president Jaime Ysmael said <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/200045-new-greenhills-mall-san-juan-2021/"">back in&nbsp;2018</a> on Greenhills&#8217; <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/travel-and-food/215125-ortigas-company-big-plans-malls-greenhills-estancia-tiendesitas/"">P60-billion redevelopment</a>.  </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-reviving-greenhills"">Reviving Greenhills</h5>



<p>How do you then solve a problem like Greenhills? </p>



<p>San Juan City, Ortigas Land, the Chinese-Filipino community, the Moro traders, and other stakeholders will have to go to the history of San Juan as well as the story of Greenhills and identify what will make people, especially those who do not live in the city, return to Greenhills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some ideas from someone who lived in San Juan for 25 years.  </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-1-a-wattah-wattah-park"">1. A &#8216;Wattah Wattah&#8217; Park</h5>



<p>San Juan is famous for the feast of its patron saint, St. John the Baptist. Every year, except during the pandemic, June 24 is celebrated by dousing people with water. This “<em>Basaan</em>” (get wet) tradition, which commemorates Jesus Christ’s baptism by St. John, is now called the city’s “Wattah, Wattah” festival.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ortigas Land, the owner of Greenhills Shopping Center, should tap this tradition by putting up a “Wattah, Wattah” park. The park should have water sprouting from the top or from underneath, and they should let people, especially kids, have fun by getting wet in the park. </p>

<p>Many countries already have such water parks where people are allowed to get wet. The Philippines’ tropical climate is ideal for water activities. Malls such as Bonifacio High Street have water parks but these establishments generally do not allow kids to play with the water. </p>

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-2-greenhills-mosque"">2. Greenhills Mosque</h5>



<p>Ortigas Land should work with the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos and the Moro traders in Greenhills on building a mosque, not just a prayer room, the Greenhills Masjid, which is located in a parking building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Greenhills is the best place to promote the culture and traditions of our Moro brothers given that many of the traders there are <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/trade-fair-showcases-unique-marawi-culture-resilience-five-years-after-siege/"">Maranaos</a>. Both Ortigas Land and the Moro traders have gained from the growth of commerce in Greenhills. A significant number of these traders have become wealthy. They drive SUVs and live in upscale homes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s time for Ortigas Land to give back to the community by allocating a space that will showcase Islamic traditions and practices. The mosque doesn’t have to be big, but it should be visible to the public, unlike the existing 500-square-meter prayer room.&nbsp;There are several beautiful Catholic chapels on top of some of the malls in Metro Manila that can serve as inspirations for a Greenhills Mosque that the country can be proud of. The <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-culture/64593-beautiful-mosques-philippines/"">Grand Mosque (Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Masjid) in Cotabato City </a>(see photos below), designed by Filipino firm, Palafox Associates, is an example of Islamic architectural beauty. </p>

<p>Filipinos pay too little attention to the business opportunities that the Islamic world offers. It will be good for the Philippine economy if it can get more Muslim tourists and increase trade with Islamic countries, especially by tapping the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/72716-ph-asean-advantage-halal-certified/"">huge halal market</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Related to this, Greenhills can be marketed as a symbol of religious tolerance. It is one of the few places in the Philippines where a Catholic chapel exists very close to a Muslim prayer room as well as one of the centers of a Christian fundamentalist group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Catholic Church’s Chapel of the Holy family is the most visible in Greenhills as it stands at the center of the shopping center.&nbsp;</p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FGreenhillsCenter%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0PE6AM5gX9yaRSmXV3FjpEqAQuKuPCFtfozvAJSjitgCnLihygFiitj8ai5Q1GHuEl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""635"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p>At the fourth floor of V-Mall (formerly Virra Mall), is the Greenhills home of the born-again Christian group, Victory. It has 7 services every Sunday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Except for an incident in 2004 when some Greenhills residents opposed the expansion of the Masjid, there has been peace and harmony among those who live and work in Greenhills. </p>



<p>San Juan City government can urge schools and religious institutions to have field trips to see this symbol of religious tolerance. It can also include a side trip to the Iglesia Ni Cristo&#8217;s former central office in F. Manalo Street. These trips should explain how understanding and accepting various faiths advances peace-building. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-3-funko-pop-museum"">3. Funko Pop Museum</h5>



<p>Greenhills should seriously think of putting up the Philippines’ largest Funko Pop Museum. It is already the go-to place for Funko Pop collectors in the country. V-Mall and Shoppesville are well-known for stores that sell Funko Pop and other collectibles.&nbsp;</p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbigboystoystore%2Fphotos%2Fa.1974083565958866%2F1974091065958116%2F%3Ftype%3D3&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""331"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p>The Funk Pop museum should be Instagrammable and allow shoppers to have photos taken with their favorite Funko Pop. It should also have a Filipiniana section, given the growing number of Filipinos and Filipino creations recognized via Funko Pops. The collection should include Jollibee, Darna, Bella Poarch, Jose Mari Chan, UAAP teams, and Mickey Mouse in <em>Barong Tagalog</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-4-chinatown-food-hall"">4. Chinatown food hall</h5>



<p>San Juan City is essentially a &#8220;Chinatown&#8221; since many Chinese-Filipinos live in city. Among the best schools in the city are Xavier School and Immaculate Conception Academy, which have many <em>Tsinoy </em>students and alumnae.</p>



<p>The city, however, does not have a small picturesque Chinatown that offers Chinese cuisine. Greenhills should establish a food hall that houses all kinds of Chinese food such as Cantonese, Taiwanese, Szechuan, Fujian. </p>



<p>The food hall should be designed like a mini-Chinatown, with structures such as pagodas, lanterns and other Chinese symbols that would be attractive for selfies, such as this Instagrammable spot (below) at the entrance to Lucky Chinatown mall in Binondo, Manila. </p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FLuckyChinatown%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0366iFywB613erej1ywA65hksCmYj8fMLpoSpvmALbDhwXTdX4ZoVRJfhiBv3neQzhl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""514"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p>Ortigas Land can also take a cue from Araneta Center’s Palenque, a food hall that houses Philippine cuisine from north to south, including a Chinese restaurant – Chicken Fandian – that started in Binondo.&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-5-basketball-exhibition"">5. Basketball exhibition</h5>



<p>A long time ago, there was a small basketball-themed restaurant in the former Crossroads Arcade (now Greenhills Promenade). It also had a display stand with lots of basketball memorabilia such as toys and keychains. </p>



<p>Given that San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora is a former college basketball player of the De La Salle University (DLSU), he should urge Greenhills to put up a museum/exhibit area with standees of famous basketball players both in the UAAP and the PBA, and even celebrities who play hoops such as Manny Pacquiao, Daniel Padilla, Donnie Pangilinan, Gerald Anderson, and Zanjoe Marudo. &nbsp;</p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMayorFrancisZamora%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0VVDLAxB9z3kq6mQ3gfZv5dgvgpvedj1RVmTCjffUXvumsgoKbxJJBUazXVLjNZEVl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""569"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p>PBA veteran James Yap, a longtime resident of San Juan and now a city councilor, should urge his colleagues in the league to join in this endeavor. He should even put up an outlet of his barber shop as a possible centerpiece, plus a small café.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the San Juan City website, the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/70638-philippines-seizes-art-marcos-property/"">Marcos House on Ortega Street</a> is “where the late strongman spent his days as a congressman and senator of the Philippine stand where the Marcos family stayed for 10 years before moving to Malacañang after winning the presidency in 1965.”</p>

<p>Ortigas Land should put up a South Sea Pearl Museum that will showcase the Philippines’ pearl industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It should have audio-visual presentations of the pearl production process, including information on how to determine authenticity of South Sea Pearls.

<p>These are just a few ideas of how to bring back people to Greenhills. To make these work, the stakeholders will have to think of the benefits that will come from bringing the shopping vibe back to Greenhills: higher tax collections for the city, more revenues for business establishments, and a better life for many people who work in Greenhills. – <a href=""http://Rappler.com"">Rappler.com</a>&nbsp;</p>

","<p>Greenhills used to be the Philippines&#8217; shopping mecca. Not anymore. How to bring back the good old days? </p>
",https://www.rappler.com/voices/rappler-blogs/reimagining-greenhills-shopping-center-park-museum-mosque-gallery-establishments/,2024-02-06T11:00:00,2024-02-06T16:51:21,"[621, 625, 623, 759, 755]","Reimagining Greenhills: A water park, mosque, Funko Pop museum, South Sea Pearls gallery, and more","  For the nth time, Greenhills Shopping Center (GSC) has again landed on the United States Trade Representative's (USTR)  Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy  (Notorious Markets List). It is the lone physical market of the Philippines on the 2023 list.       GSC continues to sell counterfeit goods such as electronics, perfumes, watches, shoes, accessories, and other fashion items, according to the USTR's latest report released on January 30, 2024.       Greenhills' inclusion in the list again shows the weak rule of law in the Philippines. As the USTR said, ""[Property] Rights holders report enforcement activity in the form of warning letters and subsequent suspension of business, but the targets of enforcement often evade such efforts by moving the location of their stalls.""       But counterfeit products have ceased to be Greenhills' main attraction. Online shopping, anti-piracy drives, and technological changes have combined to substantially reduce the foot traffic in what was once the go-to place for shopping in Metro Manila.       If Greenhills wants to bring back life to what it says is the Philippines' first shopping complex, it will have to work with the San Juan City government and other private establishments in drawing up a master plan. They will have to creative.       With more Filipinos traveling abroad and seeing what other countries have to offer in terms of shopping and entertainment, mall-goers expect unique experiences. They want Instagrammable spots that they can share with friends and families on social media. They want to taste food that aren't available in the areas where they reside or work. They want to be enriched by history and culture.       As a longtime former resident of San Juan City, I am saddened by what's become of Greenhills. Gone is the hustle and bustle of shoppers, the excitement in buying good finds. I have thus come up with some ideas on how to bring non-residents of the city back to Greenhills. Since San Juan is the smallest city in Metro Manila with 126,347 people, it has to attract the majority who do not live there.       Overhaul Greenhills Project      But first, a quick summary of what's been the official responses to the inclusion of Greenhills in USTR's Notorious Markets List:         On February 2, 2024, the Intellectual Property Rights of the Philippines (IPOPHL) said it continues to work with the National Committee on Intellectual Property Rights (NCIPR), which it chairs, in fulfilling the work plan Overhaul Greenhills Project (OG Project) to eliminate the stores selling counterfeit products.       Under the OG Project, the NCIPR was supposed to collaborate more with Greenhills ""with hopes of compelling the shopping center to implement stricter monitoring of their stalls and impose heftier penalties against sellers of counterfeit products,"" the IPOPHL said a year ago or in February 2023.       The year before, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between IPOPHL and the Philippine Retailers Association (PRA) on a code of conduct in the fight against piracy was signed on March 30. Since GSC is part of the PRA, it was thought that the MOU would ""help stamp out counterfeit trade the the lone physical Philippine market still on the list.""      IPOPHL had also hoped that San Juan City would ""fully enforce"" the Intellectual Property Code of 1997 and the Department of the Interior and Local Government's (DILG) IP-related issuances on anti-counterfeit and anti-piracy policies.       San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora vowed in 2023 that the city would strongly enforce the law by strictly monitoring the shopping center, but the sale of counterfeit products continued.           BUSY NO MORE. The  tiangge  area in Greenhills Shopping Area in San Juan City no longer gets high foot traffic, even during the Christmas season, as this photo taken on December 13, 2023 shows. Ortigas Land will be moving these shops to its new GH Mall as it tries to stamp out sellers of counterfeit products. Isagani de Castro, Jr./Rappler       ""Truly, clearing Greenhills of IP infringement activities will not be an easy feat. Its long-standing reputation as a market for Class As and Bs and pirated DVDs has cut across generations. The problem demands the close and consistent collaboration among NCIPR members, local governments, brand owners and Greenhills - both its managers and vendors. Equally important is the role of consumers whom we continuously enlighten about the possible harms of counterfeiting to their health, lives and households, as well as to the environment and the economy in the bigger picture and longer term,"" IPOPHL Director-General Rowel Barba said in last year's press release.       Greenhills management's long-term tack in finally putting an end to piracy in the shopping complex is the development of a new mall, which had a soft opening of its East Wing last October in time for Christmas. Under Greenhills management's plan, it will no longer allow the vendors who sell counterfeit goods in its new mall. Only the traders who sell pearls in  tiangges  and those selling genuine clothing and fashion items will be accommodated.          EAST WING. A number of people have their photos taken in Greenhills (GH) Mall's East Wing Atrium on December 2, 2023. The new wing had its soft opening in November 2023. Isagani de Castro, Jr./Rappler        In response to this, USTR said in its 2023 report that companies whose property rights have been violated ""need to wait and see the results.""       Ecommerce and piracy       Greenhills is no longer a shopping mecca. In its heyday, it used to get as many as 80,000 shoppers on weekdays and 100,000 to 120,000 on weekends.       Online shopping is probably the biggest factor behind Greenhills' decline as a bargain shopping center with unique finds. With no rent to pay (and no taxes and permits for many), those selling on ecommerce sites can sell goods at lower prices than the shops in Greenhills. For instance, mobile phones, among the hottest items bought in Greenhills years ago, are generally cheaper online than in physical stores.       Advances in technology have also killed piracy. Streaming platforms have made DVDs obsolete. Fake DVDs are now found mainly in  palengkes  (wet and dry markets), no longer in malls.       Game developers have also been able to stop the illegal copying of games, a service which was available in Greenhills two to three decades ago.       I lived in San Juan for over two decades when it was still a town of Metro Manila. For many years, especially in the '80s and '90s, shoppers filled its  tiangge  area, Virra Mall, Shoppesville, especially during Christmas, which had around 2,000 shops. Many micro and small entrepreneurs were made rich by Greenhills.       For some of the residents of San Juan who lived nearby, traffic got so bad that it was faster to walk to the place. Parking was always difficult, and the roads surrounding Greenhills Shopping Center would be lined up with cars parked on the streets. Shops closed not earlier than 10 pm during the Yuletide season.       When I visited Greenhills Shopping Center last December in what was supposed to be its peak month, parking was a breeze, what with its new multi-level parking buildings in front, and the multi-level parking on top of Unimart grocery.         GH. Ortigas Land's new Greenhills Mall's (GH Mall) East Wing had its soft opening in November 2023, part of a P60-billion redevelopment of Metro Manila's ""first shopping complex."" Isagani de Castro, Jr./Rappler       Ortigas Land had a soft opening of the new East Wing of what it now calls GH Mall last November, and there was hardly any buzz about it. Except for a few unique ones, the tenants in GH Mall can also be found in other malls in the capital.       Greenhills will be moving its pearl market and the other  tiangges  to this new wing. Five levels of the mall will be the new areas for the 2,000  tiangge  stalls of the shopping complex.       ""The  tiangge  will be a section in the mall. It will be more organized but still be a bargain shopping haven,"" then-Ortigas & Company president Jaime Ysmael said  back in 2018  on Greenhills'  P60-billion redevelopment .        Reviving Greenhills      How do you then solve a problem like Greenhills?       San Juan City, Ortigas Land, the Chinese-Filipino community, the Moro traders, and other stakeholders will have to go to the history of San Juan as well as the story of Greenhills and identify what will make people, especially those who do not live in the city, return to Greenhills.       Here are some ideas from someone who lived in San Juan for 25 years.        1. A ‘Wattah Wattah' Park      San Juan is famous for the feast of its patron saint, St. John the Baptist. Every year, except during the pandemic, June 24 is celebrated by dousing people with water. This "" Basaan "" (get wet) tradition, which commemorates Jesus Christ's baptism by St. John, is now called the city's ""Wattah, Wattah"" festival.       Ortigas Land, the owner of Greenhills Shopping Center, should tap this tradition by putting up a ""Wattah, Wattah"" park. The park should have water sprouting from the top or from underneath, and they should let people, especially kids, have fun by getting wet in the park.         WATER PLAY. Kids play with water sprouting from the ground in an alley in between shopping establishments at Manly Wharf in Sydney, Australia, on October 25, 2019.  Isagani de Castro, Jr./Rappler          Many countries already have such water parks where people are allowed to get wet. The Philippines' tropical climate is ideal for water activities. Malls such as Bonifacio High Street have water parks but these establishments generally do not allow kids to play with the water.               2. Greenhills Mosque      Ortigas Land should work with the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos and the Moro traders in Greenhills on building a mosque, not just a prayer room, the Greenhills Masjid, which is located in a parking building.       Greenhills is the best place to promote the culture and traditions of our Moro brothers given that many of the traders there are  Maranaos . Both Ortigas Land and the Moro traders have gained from the growth of commerce in Greenhills. A significant number of these traders have become wealthy. They drive SUVs and live in upscale homes.       It's time for Ortigas Land to give back to the community by allocating a space that will showcase Islamic traditions and practices. The mosque doesn't have to be big, but it should be visible to the public, unlike the existing 500-square-meter prayer room. There are several beautiful Catholic chapels on top of some of the malls in Metro Manila that can serve as inspirations for a Greenhills Mosque that the country can be proud of. The  Grand Mosque (Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Masjid) in Cotabato City  (see photos below), designed by Filipino firm, Palafox Associates, is an example of Islamic architectural beauty.               Filipinos pay too little attention to the business opportunities that the Islamic world offers. It will be good for the Philippine economy if it can get more Muslim tourists and increase trade with Islamic countries, especially by tapping the  huge halal market .       Related to this, Greenhills can be marketed as a symbol of religious tolerance. It is one of the few places in the Philippines where a Catholic chapel exists very close to a Muslim prayer room as well as one of the centers of a Christian fundamentalist group.       The Catholic Church's Chapel of the Holy family is the most visible in Greenhills as it stands at the center of the shopping center.               At the fourth floor of V-Mall (formerly Virra Mall), is the Greenhills home of the born-again Christian group, Victory. It has 7 services every Sunday.       Except for an incident in 2004 when some Greenhills residents opposed the expansion of the Masjid, there has been peace and harmony among those who live and work in Greenhills.       San Juan City government can urge schools and religious institutions to have field trips to see this symbol of religious tolerance. It can also include a side trip to the Iglesia Ni Cristo's former central office in F. Manalo Street. These trips should explain how understanding and accepting various faiths advances peace-building.       3. Funko Pop Museum      Greenhills should seriously think of putting up the Philippines' largest Funko Pop Museum. It is already the go-to place for Funko Pop collectors in the country. V-Mall and Shoppesville are well-known for stores that sell Funko Pop and other collectibles.               The Funk Pop museum should be Instagrammable and allow shoppers to have photos taken with their favorite Funko Pop. It should also have a Filipiniana section, given the growing number of Filipinos and Filipino creations recognized via Funko Pops. The collection should include Jollibee, Darna, Bella Poarch, Jose Mari Chan, UAAP teams, and Mickey Mouse in  Barong Tagalog .           In celebration of our 124th PH Independence Day, we're giving away over 100 Jollibee Funko Pop!

CEO Eric Bautista (extreme left), Funko Funatic Philippines founder Nikko Lim (2nd right), and then-DOT Assistant Secretary for Branding and Marketing Communications Howard Lance Uyking in May 2022. Department of Tourism       4. Chinatown food hall      San Juan City is essentially a ""Chinatown"" since many Chinese-Filipinos live in city. Among the best schools in the city are Xavier School and Immaculate Conception Academy, which have many  Tsinoy  students and alumnae.      The city, however, does not have a small picturesque Chinatown that offers Chinese cuisine. Greenhills should establish a food hall that houses all kinds of Chinese food such as Cantonese, Taiwanese, Szechuan, Fujian.       The food hall should be designed like a mini-Chinatown, with structures such as pagodas, lanterns and other Chinese symbols that would be attractive for selfies, such as this Instagrammable spot (below) at the entrance to Lucky Chinatown mall in Binondo, Manila.               Ortigas Land can also take a cue from Araneta Center's Palenque, a food hall that houses Philippine cuisine from north to south, including a Chinese restaurant - Chicken Fandian - that started in Binondo.                                                Long time coming: Palenque offers Philippine regional cuisine from north to south                                                                                         5. Basketball exhibition      A long time ago, there was a small basketball-themed restaurant in the former Crossroads Arcade (now Greenhills Promenade). It also had a display stand with lots of basketball memorabilia such as toys and keychains.       Given that San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora is a former college basketball player of the De La Salle University (DLSU), he should urge Greenhills to put up a museum/exhibit area with standees of famous basketball players both in the UAAP and the PBA, and even celebrities who play hoops such as Manny Pacquiao, Daniel Padilla, Donnie Pangilinan, Gerald Anderson, and Zanjoe Marudo.                PBA veteran James Yap, a longtime resident of San Juan and now a city councilor, should urge his colleagues in the league to join in this endeavor. He should even put up an outlet of his barber shop as a possible centerpiece, plus a small cafe.                                           View this post on Instagram                                                 A post shared by Razor Sports Official (@razorsportsph)            Other San Juan residents who should have standees in the museum are Philip Cezar, a former San Juan mayor,  Don Allado, Ervic Vijandre, and Paul Artadi .       There can also be displays of famous shoes worn by NBA and PBA players in the hall.       6. ‘City of presidents'      Greenhills can also tap San Juan's stature of being the ""City of Philippine presidents."" Three presidents have had San Juan as their residence, led by its longtime former mayor,  Joseph Estrada ; the late Ferdinand E. Marcos; and the late Diosdado Macapagal.       According to the San Juan City website, the  Marcos House on Ortega Street  is ""where the late strongman spent his days as a congressman and senator of the Philippine stand where the Marcos family stayed for 10 years before moving to Malacanang after winning the presidency in 1965.""

San Juan is also associated with the late president Corazon Aquino, whose inauguration in 1986 during the people power revolution was held in the private Club Filipino beside Greenhills Shopping Center.       San Juan and Greenhills should put up a permanent exhibit that shows these ""heritage"" residences, with a side trip to Club Filipino, a 5-minute walk from the shopping complex. This exhibit can be part of a historical field trip that can include  San Juan's Pinaglabanan Shrine, Museo ng Katipunan, Musel El Deposito, El Deposito Underground, and Santuario Del Santo Cristo .       San Juan City can hire jeepney drivers affected by the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program for a hop-on, hop-off route in these historic tourist attractions.                                                Rethinking the jeepney phaseout from a tourism viewpoint                                                                                         7. South Sea Pearls Museum      Ortigas Land should put up a South Sea Pearl Museum that will showcase the Philippines' pearl industry.       It should have audio-visual presentations of the pearl production process, including information on how to determine authenticity of South Sea Pearls. There should be visuals of the producers, maps of the places where these are made, information on Filipino gemologists as well as  Philippine jewelry companies . Most importantly, there should be displays of the end-products such as on crowns - or their replicas - with  South Sea pearls worn by beauty queens .        MAJESTIC.

To make these work, the stakeholders will have to think of the benefits that will come from bringing the shopping vibe back to Greenhills: higher tax collections for the city, more revenues for business establishments, and a better life for many people who work in Greenhills. -  Rappler.com        ALSO ON RAPPLER         Beautiful mosques in the Philippines        Gokongweis dream big, launch 'The Jewel' to match Marina Bay Sands, Twin Towers, Taipei 101        New Greenhills mall coming in 2021        What's a Singapore-style mall, anyway?

<p>PAMPANGA, Philippines – Angeles Mayor Carmelo Lazatin Jr. ordered a city-wide inspection of water sources after local health officials warned of a sudden rise in gastroenteritis cases in the city.</p>



<p>At least 75 people in Angeles were documented to have fallen ill due to gastroenteritis in just a week’s time, 62% of which were recorded over the weekend.</p>



<p>Alarmed, Lazatin issued Memorandum Circular No. 370-2024, directing the City Health Office (CHO), City General Services Office, and the Business Permit and Licensing Division to organize teams to carry out a city-wide inspection of water sources.</p>



<p>The inspections would include public and private schools, hospitals, canteens, cafeterias, and even city hall.</p>



<p>Lazatin also ordered microbiological and chemical tests on all water suppliers and water refilling stations in the city, and for the CHO to collaborate with the Department of Health (DOH) to proactively prevent an outbreak.</p>



<p>The local government has recorded 75 people, including children, who suffered from gastroenteritis from January 29 to February 5.</p>



<p>Among those who fell ill, 25 were documented at the city government-run Rafael Lazatin Memorial Medical Center (RLMMC), 28 from different private hospitals, and 22 from the rural and barangay health centers since January 29, according to City Information Office head Arnel San Pedro.</p>



<p>San Pedro said those who contracted the virus complained of diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting, and sometimes fever.</p>



<p>Dr. Froilan Canlas, RLMMC officer-in-charge, said the cases surged in just a week’s time, and 47 of the 75 cases were documented over the weekend or from February 3 to 5.</p>



<p>Some patients came from nearby towns such as Porac, and the cities of Mabalacat and San Fernando, he said.</p>



<p>“There was a sudden but slight alarm. However, there is no clustering – meaning, they came from different areas. There is no pattern but there is an unusual increase in the number,” Canlas told Rappler on Monday.</p>



<p>Canlas, however, said only a few people had to be admitted to hospitals.</p>



<p>“Normally, those who are suffering from LBM (loose bowel movement), and vomiting, are children who lack hydration,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Viral gastroenteritis can be contracted through contact with an infected person or by consuming contaminated food or water. Most affected are infants, older adults, and people with compromised immune systems. Extra precaution on personal hygiene and sanitation is advised, said Canlas.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Lazatin called on the public to be vigilant and ensure the cleanliness of their water and food sources. – <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

2598325,jack-santiago-says-ue-red-warriors-did-best-keep-rey-remogat,UE coach: Red Warriors did best to keep Rey Remogat,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – Coach Jack Santiago said University of the East did all it could to retain star playmaker Rey Remogat, the UAAP Season 86 men’s basketball MVP runner-up who <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/sports/uaap/up-fighting-maroons-lure-ue-red-warriors-standout-rey-remogat/"">transferred</a> to the UP Fighting Maroons in January following two seasons with the Red Warriors. </p>



<p>Santiago claimed UE exerted multiple efforts to appease Remogat’s concerns, but said the school will now “move on” towards the next era of Red Warriors basketball. </p>



<p>“I just want to say that we did everything. For all of his concerns, it’s not like the school or management didn’t do anything. We did everything for him to be happy upon his requests,” Santiago told Rappler.</p>



<p>Santiago, who’s about to enter his fourth season coaching the UE men’s basketball team, didn’t specify what Remogat’s requests were and opted not to comment on whether it had something to do with financial reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Santiago also expressed disappointment that Remogat still opted to leave UE when it was understood – at least from his perspective – that the star player would stay following the conclusion of UAAP Season 86, and also because the ace guard confirmed his desire to remain a Red Warrior in an interview with CNN Philippines.</p>



<p>“We did our best to keep Noy,” Santiago said. “What happened, happened. We just need to move on.”</p>



<p>But Santiago is hopeful that the UAAP board of directors will make moves to limit the recent trend of student-athletes transferring universities in order to level the playing field.</p>



<p>Remogat is the third major standout Santiago has lost following the departure of Gani Stevens and Kyle Paranada, who transferred to UP and UST, respectively, in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I hope the UAAP does something with what’s been happening. This is staining the league. It’s not good for the other schools, especially a school like ours that doesn’t have the same capacity as other schools,” Santiago said.</p>



<p>“Hopefully UE, along with other schools, don’t become farm teams. Hopefully the UAAP board can put a stop to this. This is for the benefit of the league. I hope this doesn’t destroy the UAAP.”</p>



<p>Santiago said he empathizes with disappointed fans of the UE community who feel their players were “poached,” but hopes they can find solace in the fact that the school used the best of its abilities to bring Remogat back for Season 87 and beyond.</p>



<p>“The management did our part to help Noy, but at the end of the day, we don’t know what the player’s decision will be,” said Santiago, who’s still confident in his team’s ability to compete in 2024 despite Remogat’s exit. </p>



<p>“Definitely, Noy’s departure is huge. Everyone knows what he’s capable of. But that’s why I told the players they need to step up and for them to do what Remogat did. We have a lot of recruits and I’m not worried for this coming season. We have a lot of new players that will arrive who are going to be eligible to play. Hopefully they improve right away. Our plan this year is to make the Final Four.”</p>



<p>The Red Warriors are looking to end a Final Four drought that dates back to 2009, the last time they also made the UAAP finals.</p>



<p>UE is expected to welcome back Gjerard Wilson, whose first go as a Red Warrior in 2023 was cut short by a shoulder labrum tear. It will be his final season of eligibility in Season 87. In addition to the returning Jack Cruz-Dumont, Santiago also expects the debut of Hunter Cruz-Dumont, who’s currently recovering from a foot injury.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Red Warriors are also banking on the improvement of foreign student-athlete Precious Momowei – the leader of the Season 86 Rookie of the Year race before his suspension – and John Abate, the son of former PBA All-Star John Arigo who redshirted in 2023. </p>



<p>Santiago also expects still unannounced recruits to join the Red Warriors in the coming months, joining a core that includes the likes of Devin Fikes, Keian Spandonis, MJ Langit, and Ethan Galang.</p>



<p>The Red Warriors finished with 5-9 and 4-10 records under Santiago’s tutelage the last two seasons. He signed a two-year contract extension with management in January 2023.&nbsp;<strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

2598045,why-1987-constitution-framer-hilario-davide-opposes-charter-change,Why 1987 Constitution framer Hilario Davide Jr.  opposes charter change,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – Former chief justice Hilario Davide Jr. said that amending the economic provisions of the Constitution would create &#8220;serious and disturbing problems and consequences.&#8221;</p>



<p>Davide, who was a member of the 1986 Constitutional Commission, was the guest resource person on Monday, February 5, at the Senate inquiry into Resolution of Both Houses No. 6 (RBH6) “proposing amendments to certain economic provisions of the 1987 Constitution.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I repeat, our problems are not due to the restrictive economic provisions of the constitution. They cannot be solved by removing its restrictive economic provisions, and completely leaving to Congress the future under the clause &#8216;unless otherwise provided by law,'&#8221; Davide said. </p>



<p>RBH6 was filed at the Senate in January to amend economic provisions of the charter which would focus on opening up to foreign investors the ownership of educational institutions, advertising, and public utilities, and  by inserting the phrase “unless otherwise provided by law.&#8221;</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-no-valid-reason"">No &#8216;valid reason&#8217;</h5>



<p>The Constitution limits foreign ownership in industries, 60% Filipino-40% foreign as a general rule, and absolutely no foreign ownership in mass media.</p>



<p>But Davide argued that there are no &#8220;valid serious and compelling reasons&#8221; to amend the the charter. </p>



<p>&#8220;What our country and our people need today are not amendments to or revision of the Constitution but the full implementation of its principles and state policies,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>Several laws and regulations have been passed in recent years that<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/diokno-says-philippine-economy-open-without-charter-change-more-can-be-done-april-2023/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">&nbsp;already opened up</a>&nbsp;the Philippine economy to the world without having to amend the Constitution. (READ: <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/how-philippine-economy-opened-up-world-without-charter-change/"">How Philippine economy opened up to the world without charter change</a>)</p>



<p>One recent example is the enactment of <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/duterte-completes-liberal-economic-agenda-signing-public-service-act/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Republic Act (RA) 11659</a> or the Public Service Act in March 2022, which distinguishes the difference between a public service and a public utility. Under this law, public utility no longer includes telecommunication, shipping, airline, railway, toll road, and transport network vehicle industries. Because of the PSA, these industries are no longer subjected to the 40% constitutional limit on foreign ownership. Simply put, foreigners can now fully own corporations in these industries.</p>



<p>RBH6 also proposed the same clauses to the provisions on basic educational institutions and the advertising industry, so that there will be an an opportunity to enact laws to lift or ease the cap on the 60-40% foreign restriction on the former, and the 70-30% on the latter.</p>



<p>Davide said that opening the country&#8217;s educational institutions to foreigners would make schools vulnerable to foreign control, adding that this would undermine the “noble patriotic and nationalistic virtues.&#8221;</p>



<p>Article 14, Section 3 of the Constitution states that &#8220;all educational institutions shall include the study of the Constitution as part of the curricula.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Can we expect foreigners at the helm or control of the educational system to seriously and healthily obey this state policy on education?” Davide rhetorically asked. </p>



<p>&#8220;If, at all, there is a need to amend the constitution, it must be based on the most compelling grounds or reasons,&#8221; the retired chief justice said. </p>



<p>Davide said that proposed economic revisions pertaining to agriculture, land ownership and lease are not the culprits or the causes of our massive social economic, political, moral and ethical problems and debacles. </p>



<p>&#8220;These were all caused by the failures to fully implement or enforce the constitution, by poor governance and accountability, and open violations of the public trust character of the public office enshrined in Section 1 of Article 11 of the Constitution which provides &#8216;public office is a public trust,'&#8221; he said. </p>

RBH6 also proposed the same clauses to the provisions on basic educational institutions and the advertising industry, so that there will be an an opportunity to enact laws to lift or ease the cap on the 60-40% foreign restriction on the former, and the 70-30% on the latter.      Davide said that opening the country's educational institutions to foreigners would make schools vulnerable to foreign control, adding that this would undermine the ""noble patriotic and nationalistic virtues.""      Article 14, Section 3 of the Constitution states that ""all educational institutions shall include the study of the Constitution as part of the curricula.""      ""Can we expect foreigners at the helm or control of the educational system to seriously and healthily obey this state policy on education?"" Davide rhetorically asked.       ""If, at all, there is a need to amend the constitution, it must be based on the most compelling grounds or reasons,"" the retired chief justice said.       Davide said that proposed economic revisions pertaining to agriculture, land ownership and lease are not the culprits or the causes of our massive social economic, political, moral and ethical problems and debacles.       ""These were all caused by the failures to fully implement or enforce the constitution, by poor governance and accountability, and open violations of the public trust character of the public office enshrined in Section 1 of Article 11 of the Constitution which provides ‘public office is a public trust,'"" he said.

All previous attempts fizzled out as their Senate counterparts were not too keen on amending the Constitution, especially through a constituent assembly.  - Rappler.com   ",Neutral
2597381,sexualized-jesus-causes-outrage-spain-christians-long-fascinated-christ-body,&#8216;Sexualized&#8217; Jesus causes outrage in Spain – but Christians have long been fascinated by Christ’s body,"
<p>There has been backlash from some conservative Catholics in Spain this February, who object to an image of Jesus on a poster used to promote Holy Week in Seville. The image has been described as <a href=""https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/homoerotic-christ-posters-holy-week-divides-spain-seville-667rcrrm0"">homoerotic</a>, <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/01/29/spanish-catholics-denounce-offensive-jesus-poster/"">effeminate, camp</a> and <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/01/29/spanish-catholics-denounce-offensive-jesus-poster/"">sexualized</a>.</p>



<p>Religious imagery is widespread in western popular culture, from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79fzeNUqQbQ"">music videos</a> to <a href=""https://theconversation.com/the-pope-wears-prada-how-religion-and-fashion-connected-at-met-gala-2018-96290"">fashion</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=2NW_G20ioJ4"">TV shows</a> to advertising. In her book <a href=""https://sheffieldphoenix.com/product/admen-and-eve-the-bible-in-contemporary-advertising/""><em>Admen and Eve</em></a>, writer Katie Edwards explains that “Eve is quite the money maker” and signposts the prolific use of Eve in marketing campaigns for products including <a href=""https://www.origsin.com/original-sin-hard-cider-genesis"">cider</a>, <a href=""https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/snow-white-eve-apples"">cereal</a>, <a href=""https://tobacco.stanford.edu/cigarettes/womens-cigarettes/eve/"">cigarettes</a>, and <a href=""https://www.fashiongonerogue.com/dkny-be-desired-perfume/"">perfumes</a>.</p>



<p>In my own research, I have explored representations of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.bibleandcriticaltheory.com/vol-16-no-1-2020-profit-over-prophet-a-critical-analysis-of-moses-in-advertising-christopher-greenough/"">Moses in advertising</a>. The figure of Moses, an elderly, male, disabled prophet from the book of Exodus, is usually replaced by young, nude women shown parting the red sea, in various advertisements including&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.adsoftheworld.com/campaigns/pool-ea7d93d0-b491-4333-99e8-299bc10fbb21"">one for suncream</a>.</p>



<p>While the use of religious characters such as Eve and Moses often goes unnoticed, adverts that use the image of Jesus frequently cause an outcry. There’s been a backlash against using his image in advertising, including for <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-41997936"">Greggs’ vegan rolls</a>, <a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/phones4u-jesus-ad-samsung_n_952666"">Samsung mobile phones</a>, and even <a href=""https://www.adsoftheworld.com/campaigns/jesus-mary-what-a-style"">jeans</a>.</p>

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-the-history-of-icons-and-the-church"">The history of icons and the church</h5>



<p>The current outrage in Spain has precedents. There has been anger about explicit images of Jesus used in films about his life such as Monty Python’s <a href=""https://www.montypython.com/film_Monty%20Python's%20Life%20of%20Brian%20(1979)/14"">“blasphemous”</a> film <em>Life of Brian</em> (1979) and Mel Gibson’s <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> (2004), which depicts the <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/passion-of-the-christ-15-years-mel-gibson-jim-cavieziel-movie-reaction-christianity-a8788381.html"">crucifixion as a bloody sacrifice</a>. Some portrayals of the crucifixion have been implicit, such as Cersei’s walk of shame in<em> <a href=""https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4z7zlm"">Game of Thrones</a></em>, which echoes the <em><a href=""https://www.holylandsite.com/via-dolorosa"">Via Dolorosa</a></em> — the path Jesus walked to the crucifixion.</p>



<p>Certain denominations of Christianity, such as Pentecostalism and Methodism, do not engage with icons or images of God, following their prohibition in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A4&amp;version=NIV"">book of Exodus</a>. Yet, icons have a long and significant history in the Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions, as objects worthy of veneration.</p>



<p>Representations of Jesus are prolific in this sense. The depiction of the crucifixion – his semi-nude, broken body on a cross – adorns churches and jewelry worldwide. So much so that we have become almost desensitized to the violence depicted in this type of image. These images are often in children’s classrooms if they attend faith schools.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-christianity-and-the-body"">Christianity and the body</h5>



<p>Art critic Leo Steinberg’s book, <a href=""https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo4092467.html""><em>The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and Modern Oblivion</em></a> (1983), showcases how crucifixion imagery was once quite explicit, as historically many images did not afford Jesus the modesty of a loincloth. Jesus’ body has always been a <a href=""https://www.routledge.com/Indecent-Theology/Althaus-Reid/p/book/9780415236041"">site of controversy</a>, despite Christianity being a religion that is quite concerned with bodies.</p>



<p>Christianity is an embodied religion, where beliefs are not simply spiritual, but are enacted through, by and on the body. Think <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%201%3A18-25&amp;version=NRSVACE"">immaculate conceptions and virgin births</a>. Sacraments such as baptism (immersion in water), anointing, and the Eucharist involve physical movements (praying, bowing) and the senses (tasting, smelling) alongside visual, sacred symbols.</p>



<p>God becoming flesh – the incarnation – is the basis of Christian understandings of Jesus. In Roman Catholicism, there is a belief in <a href=""https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/transubstantiation-for-beginners"">transubstantiation</a>, that Christ is present in the consumption of the bread and wine (representing body and blood) during Holy Communion. The bread, or wafer, literally becomes Christ’s body for human consumption, following Jesus’ instruction <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Matthew%2026%3A26"">“take this and eat it, this is my body.”</a> In her book<em> <a href=""https://www.routledge.com/Indecent-Theology/Althaus-Reid/p/book/9780415236041"">Indecent Theology</a></em> (2000), the late queer theologian, Marcella Althaus-Reid describes such an activity as “cannibalistic.”</p>



<p>In my own book <em><a href=""https://www.routledge.com/The-Bible-and-Sexual-Violence-Against-Men/Greenough/p/book/9780367562878#:%7E:text=The%20Bible%20and%20Sexual%20Violence%20Against%20Men%20argues%20that%20the,world%20and%20biblical%20texts%20themselves."">The Bible and Sexual Violence Against Men</a> </em>(2021), I explore how Jesus is presented as asexual, both in the Bible and in Christian theology. The Bible tells very little of Jesus’ sexuality, and for a Jewish man in his 30s, the absence of wife and family would have been noticeable.</p>



<p>Asexuality seems to be a family affair. It’s suggested that his earthly parents, the virgin Mary and Joseph were both abstinent or celibate. Such celibacy is proscribed for priests in Roman Catholicism, and marriage is tackled in Paul’s <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207-9&amp;version=NIV"">letter to the Corinthians</a>, where he says “it is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do.”</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-representation-and-reception"">Representation and reception</h5>



<p>Those in Spain who have objected to Jesus being portrayed as “effeminate,” “camp,” or “sexualized” seem to imply that there is something wrong or deviant about such portrayals. More globally, this speaks back to the legacy of homophobia in certain conservative Christian settings and the use of <a href=""https://theconversation.com/using-the-bible-against-lgbtq-people-is-an-abuse-of-scripture-110128"">the Bible in this</a>. The debate continues, even with inclusive advancements from Pope Francis in relation to the <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/pope-francis-eases-barriers-blessing-same-sex-marriage-1864328"">blessing of same-sex unions.</a></p>



<p>While controversies reign around the image of a “sexualized” Jesus in Spain, this portrayal has a more obvious controversy that has not received attention. Jesus, a Middle Eastern, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/jesus-wasnt-white-he-was-a-brown-skinned-middle-eastern-jew-heres-why-that-matters-91230"">brown-skinned man</a>, has been white-washed. The depiction of Jesus as a white European is <a href=""https://theconversation.com/the-long-history-of-how-jesus-came-to-resemble-a-white-european-142130"">problematic</a>.</p>



<p>In Matthew’s gospel, Jesus is reported to ask: <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016%3A15-16&amp;version=NIV"">“Who do you say that I am?</a>&#8221; Representations and images of Jesus are often context specific and context based – and therefore the reception of such images are, too. <strong>– The Conversation|Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>“The Palarong Pambansa is an integral part of our efforts to strengthen our grassroots sports programs, granting various opportunities for sports-inclined youth and exposing them to real-life experiences in their chosen sports,” Duterte said in a speech during the MOA signing.</p>

<p>This is the third time that Cebu City will be hosting the grand sports event — the first hosting was in 1954 and later, in 1994. According to Duterte, this is the 64th edition of the Palarong Pambansa since it <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/199945-things-to-know-palarong-pambansa-philippines/"">started in 1948</a>.</p>

<p>“[We] still have ongoing consultations for the school calendar and we will have to wait for the approved school calendar if there is going to be one,” said Bringas.</p>



<p>Last August, Cebu City Sports Commission chairperson John Pages shared they’re expecting at least 12,000 athletes and 25,000 visitors from all over the country to join the Palarong Pambansa 2024.</p>



<p>During a press conference on Friday morning, Pages announced that around 20 schools in the city will be used as billeting quarters for the athletes who will be coming to Cebu City.</p>



<p>“What we’re focusing on right now is the rehabilitation of our facilities, our swimming pool, our track oval will be all new and we are very blessed in Cebu City to have a lot of universities and malls that we are partnering with as venues,” the sports commission chair said.</p>

<p>Pages stated that 70 percent of the sports events are indoor activities and that the city will be utilizing venues like indoor tennis courts to address weather concerns.</p>

<p>According to Cebu City Councilor Dondon Hontiveros, the city council approved a budget allocation worth P200 million to assist the sports commission’s undertaking for the Palaro hosting.</p>

<p>Bringas assured the athletes that there will be financial support for students who will come from the school division offices of the participating regions.</p>



<p>“We will be expecting our learners to experience playing in world-class facilities,” Bringas said.</p>

<p>LAGUNA, Philippines – The death toll in the firecracker factory explosion in Cabuyao City, Laguna, on Thursday, February 1, rose to four after two more victims succumbed while receiving treatment in a hospital.</p>



<p>The explosion, which started a fire in Purok 3, Barangay Bigaa, left five people injured, as reported by the police on Friday morning, February 2.</p>



<p>Two persons died on the spot on Thursday,&nbsp;while several others, including two minors, were seriously injured in the explosion and fire.</p>



<p>Brigadier General Kenneth Lucas, Philippine National Police-Calabarzon director, said the explosion killed John Ronald Gonzales Deduro and Marvin Lamela Ocom on the spot, while Ricardo Olic-Olic, Bebot Reymundodia died while being treated in two separate hospitals.</p>



<p>Tita Mye, a witness, told Rappler that the ground shook because the explosion was so powerful.</p>



<p>According to Cabuyao City Police Station, the explosion and resulting fire at the Aquino Lebrilla Fireworks in Barangay Bigaa was reported at around 4 pm. Authorities declared &#8216;fire out&#8217; at 5:47 p.m.</p>



<p>Cabuyao Police Chief Lieutenant Colonel John Antonio said mishandling was the porbable cause of the explosion based on their initial assessment. Antonio added that they were still investigating  the impact of the blast and the ensuing blaze on the nearby houses and properties to assess the extent of the damage.</p>

<p>Cabuyao City Mayor Dennis Hain, in a live video uploaded on Facebook, requested all private hospitals as well as drug stores to provide all the medical needs of the victims of the explosion. Immediate treatment should be given, especially to those who sustained burns, he said.</p>



<p>Hain said the city government will cover the cost as the Cabuyao Hospital could not provide complete treatment to all those who have sustained injuries.</p>



<p>“An unfortunate incident happened in Barangay Bigaa with the explosion at the fireworks factory with many reported casualties, injured people, and some even critical. It’s sad that there are children and elderly,” Hain said.</p>

2594407,marcos-duterte-clans-clash-should-sara-resign-from-cabinet,"As Marcos-Duterte clans clash, should Sara resign from the Cabinet?","
<p>MANILA, Philippines – It was an alliance that critics and political observers had jinxed as doomed from the start. The only questions were, when and what would happen to Vice President Sara Duterte, who is still a member of the Marcos Cabinet.</p>



<p>They got a partial answer on January 28. The day that Marcos launched &#8220;Bagong Pilipinas&#8221; in Manila and promised to transform the country into a new and better version, down south, Davao City Mayor Sebastian &#8220;Baste&#8221; Duterte called for his resignation while former president Rodrigo Duterte branded the President as a &#8220;drug addict.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Vice President attended the Bagong Pilipinas launch but she also went to the prayer rally against charter change where her family members took turns lambasting the President she served as a Cabinet member. A day later, she released a statement defending her younger brother&#8217;s tirade against Marcos as &#8220;brotherly love,&#8221; in protest of her &#8220;despicable treatment&#8221; by people in the President&#8217;s circle. It was a sentiment that she apparently shared. </p>



<p>Uniteam, the marriage of political convenience that brought the Marcos-Duterte tandem to victory in the 2022 elections, crumbled on Sunday, January 28. </p>



<p>The word war between the Dutertes and the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/marcos-blames-duterte-fentanyl-use-tirades-accusations/"">Marcoses</a> has sparked calls for Sara to resign as education secretary, a job that commands 900,000 teaching staff scattered across the country.</p>

<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-stuck-to-each-other"">&#8216;Stuck to each other&#8217;</h5>



<p>Despite her family&#8217;s attacks against Marcos and her own sentiments of being ganged up on by administration allies, Sara has no plan, as yet, to leave DepEd. Her messaging, based on her January 29 statement, is that she would strive to endure the &#8220;attacks, black propaganda, and smear campaign&#8221; against her because she was elected by millions and that she would remain in the Cabinet for as long as she&#8217;s wanted. </p>



<p>In an interview on Tuesday, January 31, political analyst Cleve Arguelles said that calls for Sara to leave the DepEd did not come as a surprise, as being part of the Marcos Cabinet should mean unequivocal support for the President. </p>



<p>&#8220;But I think the more interesting question here is why is the President still keeping her after all that happened?&#8221; Arguelles said, adding, this means that &#8220;she still enjoys the confidence, the trust, and the support of the President.&#8221;</p>



<p>Marcos said as much on Tuesday, in response to questions in a media interview. He also said that his professional relationship with the Vice President is &#8220;exactly the same,&#8221; sounding like a showbiz personality trying to cover up a rocky relationship with a love team partner.</p>

<p>Just like any other popular tandem, they have to stick to each other despite their differences to keep their support bases intact. Mindanao remains a stronghold of the Duterte family and delivered votes for Marcos in the 2022 elections. Likewise, the Marcoses&#8217; &#8220;Solid North&#8221; delivered votes for Sara. </p>



<p>Marcos got 7.2 million votes in Mindanao, while Sara obtained 3.5 million votes in the Solid North.</p>



<p>&#8220;They need each other,&#8221; Arguelles said. &#8220;I think this is a paradox of the Uniteam that they’re starting to dislike each other but then they also need each other. At this point, they are stuck with each other.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sara is undeniably more popular than Marcos. Despite their ratings plunging amid a string of issues in 2023, Sara still got a 73% approval rating while Marcos got 65%, according to a <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/marcos-duterte-approval-ratings-drop-double-digits-pulse-asia-september-2023/"">Pulse Asia survey</a> in September 2023. </p>



<p>Arguelles also cited the seeming &#8220;tradition&#8221; in Philippine politics that vice presidents who break off with the president do not fare so well among voters.</p>



<p>&#8220;They don’t like a vice president [who] is not cooperative with the president,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>This is what happened to then-vice presidents Jejomar Binay and Leni Robredo. They were initially part of the Cabinet but later resigned because of divergent views. Binay had been leading the surveys for the presidency that time but he became the subject of attacks. Meanwhile, Robredo became the casualty of online propaganda discrediting her work as vice president. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-deped-as-a-stepping-stone"">DepEd as a stepping stone</h5>



<p>Sara would be on the losing end if she resigns from the Marcos Cabinet this early. The DepEd is a platform that can help her maintain a national profile, especially if she has ambitions for higher office. Based on DepEd data, there are <a href=""https://www.deped.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/4-Data-Bits-Public-School-Teachers-Apr.pdf"">876,842 </a>teaching personnel and 60,429 schools all over the country. </p>



<p>&#8220;She will stay there for as long as she could,&#8221; Arguelles said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re no longer in the Cabinet, what will you do as vice president? What power and resources will [you have]?&#8221; </p>



<p>The Philippines is among the countries that produced the lowest proficiency for young learners in reading, mathematics, and science, as indicated by the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.oecd.org/publication/pisa-2022-results/country-notes/philippines-a0882a2d/#chapter-d1e11"">Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022</a>&nbsp;rankings. That fact, however, has not rubbed off on public perception of Sara&#8217;s work as education chief. In December, the same month the PISA rankings were released, pollster WR Numero conducted a survey which showed that 57% of Filipinos still think Sara is doing a good job at DepEd.</p>



<p>In her second basic education report, Sara also <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/sara-duterte-promises-more-benefits-teachers-january-2024/"">promised</a> reforms in the education sector and more benefits for teachers. Arguelles said this may be a calculated move especially if she has an eye to the 2028 elections.</p>



<p>&#8220;It will always be helpful for her to be able to say that she delivered to the education sector,&#8221; Arguelles said. </p>



<p>Amid the political bickering, there are concerns that the DepEd, which has under its care millions of Filipino students and the very future of the country, would be placed at greater risk. If Sara&#8217;s attention is further distracted by her political plans, the learning crisis in the country would worsen. Her qualifications as education chief have been in question in the first place.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really one of my worries, we can look at it from the perspective that, &#8216;Oh this is exciting,&#8217; <em>&#8216;di ba kasi </em>(because) we’re watching a showdown between these two powerful dynasties. <em>Si Vice President, isang araw lang na malingat siya</em> (If the Vice President gets distracted by even just one day), it will define the future of millions of Filipino students,&#8221; Arguelles said. </p>



<p>Critics have been calling for the President to appoint a DepEd secretary who has an education background. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-playing-the-underdog-card"">Playing the underdog card</h5>



<p>In her January 29 statement, Sara said she will endure the attacks against her out of respect for the Filipinos who had voted her into office, evoking an image of a punching bag. This is far from the image that gained her infamy over a decade ago: that of the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/nation/3391-the-mayors-duterte/"">feisty female mayor</a> who grabbed a sheriff by the collar and punched him repeatedly after he led the demolition of shanties in a community in Davao City.</p>



<p>Political analyst Arjan Aguirre said that the ongoing rift in the Uniteam coalition can be advantageous for Sara, who can play the &#8220;underdog card.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;While staying as a Cabinet member, she can still draw sympathy from the people by appearing as the underdog and bullied personality within the coalition. She just has to look like she is being bullied by the House Speaker and other personalities and use the anti-elite or anti-oligarchy card that is consistent [with] the Duterte brand of politics,&#8221; Aguirre said. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think what she wants to happen here is for the President to fire or dismiss her or openly go against her. That would mean an open war is finally happening and that it would look like the Marcos faction caused it,&#8221; he added.</p>

The only questions were, when and what would happen to Vice President Sara Duterte, who is still a member of the Marcos Cabinet.      They got a partial answer on January 28. The day that Marcos launched ""Bagong Pilipinas"" in Manila and promised to transform the country into a new and better version, down south, Davao City Mayor Sebastian ""Baste"" Duterte called for his resignation while former president Rodrigo Duterte branded the President as a ""drug addict.""      The Vice President attended the Bagong Pilipinas launch but she also went to the prayer rally against charter change where her family members took turns lambasting the President she served as a Cabinet member. A day later, she released a statement defending her younger brother's tirade against Marcos as ""brotherly love,"" in protest of her ""despicable treatment"" by people in the President's circle. It was a sentiment that she apparently shared.       Uniteam, the marriage of political convenience that brought the Marcos-Duterte tandem to victory in the 2022 elections, crumbled on Sunday, January 28.       The word war between the Dutertes and the  Marcoses  has sparked calls for Sara to resign as education secretary, a job that commands 900,000 teaching staff scattered across the country.

<p>MANILA, Philippines – After a successful investment in the critically acclaimed historical film, <em>GomBurZa</em>, tycoon Manny V. Pangilinan (MVP) is not afraid to take more gambles in the risky movie business after putting in money in the film, <em>GG</em> or <em>Good Game</em>, starring Donnie Pangilinan and his mother, actress Maricel Laxa-Pangilinan.&nbsp;</p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FGomBurZaFilm%2Fposts%2Fpfbid06pYDvbCVPq6JC4AE1A5LJSvgt9rb6eakjNXkrfx6DkPHdtvSQZ3HsVf7DJss6n4Zl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""652"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p><em>GG</em>, which opened in theaters on January 24, is jointly produced by MVP’s MQuest Ventures, Mediaworks, and Create Cinema, a production house that focuses on “groundbreaking cinema.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a high-stakes gamble for the producers since the movie veers away from the usual romance or rom-com, horror, and fantasy that moviegoers are familiar with. <em>GG</em> is the Philippines’ first full-length esports movie that depicts the challenges and victories of esports players. Donny plays Seth, an aspiring, passionate egamer. </p>



<p>Jane Basas, president and CEO of Pangilinan’s MQuest Ventures, told Rappler they’re “definitely upbeat” with the Philippine movie industry, especially after a successful Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) 2023 which set a <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/metro-manila-film-festival-mmff-2023-highest-grossing-record-exceed-one-billion-pesos/"">new box-office festival record</a> of P1.069 billion as of January 7. </p>



<p>In an email interview with Rappler, Basas said <em>GomBurZa</em> was &#8220;well-received because it appealed to the sense of nationalism that we Filipinos share, and because it told the compelling and emotionally-charged story of the martyrdom of the three Filipino priests.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Watching movies in cinemas will remain part of how Filipinos spend quality time with friends and family. Times have changed, but we are definitely upbeat because of how the Pinoy audience reacted to <em>GomBurZa</em> and the other films of the Metro Manila Film Festival. We hope to continue to do our part in growing the movie audience by producing films that people will love to watch,” she added. </p>



<p>Basas declined to say how much <em>GomBurZa</em> earned in the box-office, but MMFF chairman Don Artes earlier said most MMFF films had 8-digit earnings. </p>



<p><em>GomBurZa</em> won the most number of awards in the MMFF&#8217;s 49th edition, including 2nd Best Picture, Best Cinematography, Best Director (Pepe Diokno), Best Actor (Cedrick Juan as Father Burgos), Best Production Design, Best Sound Design, and the Gatpuno Antonio Villegas Cultural Award.</p>

<p><em>GG,</em> however, is unlikely to reach the success of the Pepe Diokno-helmed historical film, which was still showing in select Philippine cinemas four weeks after it premiered in the MMFF on December 25, 2023. Only a few cinemas were still showing <em>GG</em> as of February 1, Thursday. </p>

<p>Donnie’s father, Anthony, is leading his whole family in the big push for <em>GG</em>. It’s his first movie production and he’s using his skills as motivational speaker to get people to watch the movie.&nbsp;He&#8217;s also been active on his social media accounts, updating the public on his family&#8217;s promotional activities. </p>

<p>For instance, in his post on January 30, Tuesday, Anthony talked about the roots of the Pangilinan family in Pampanga as they visited the province in central Luzon, a roughly two-hour drive north from Manila. </p>



<p>“Not sure people know but we come from Pampanga. On my side, my Daddy Dony from Sto. Tomas, and on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/_u/mommymaricel?fbclid=IwAR2DmLKOJMhQ60MTNQJN-aFyiUD0DNGQ3SoF6mO5yEY_PX5q-HQU1UUy3tI"">@mommymaricel</a>’s side, Daddy Tony from Macabebe!” he said. </p>

<p>Former Senator Kiko Pangilinan, with 1.1 million followers on Facebook, has given his full support to his younger brother, calling <em>GG</em> a “great movie!!!” and showing up at the movie premiere on January 23. Kiko got 9.3 million votes and placed second in the 2022 vice-presidential race that was won by Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte.  </p>



<p>“<em>Ang ganda ng theme: family, passion, pagpupursige</em> (The theme is beautiful: family, passion, and perseverance),” said Kiko at the premiere. </p>

<p>Many Filipino <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/topic/esports/"">esports gamers</a> gave their support by endorsing the movie, saying the producers were able to show what an esports athlete goes through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MQuest and Mediaworks picked the most qualified film distributor for the movie, ABS-CBN’s Star Cinema. Industry veterans said Star Cinema has not just the track record in producing <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/rewind-philippines-highest-grossing-film-surpasses-hello-love-goodbye/"">box-office hits</a> and r<a href=""https://www.rappler.com/business/mmff-2023-box-office-target-offers-hope-film-industry-philippines/"">ecognizing good content</a>, but it also has a good relationship with cinema operators. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-gomburza-campaign"">GomBurZa campaign</h5>



<p><em>GG</em> adopted a similar strategy taken by <em>GomBurZa</em> – the tried and tested on-the-ground campaign as well as tri-media promotions. There are, differences, however, which could lead to a different outcome. </p>



<p>For instance, <em>GomBurZa</em> co-producer Jesuit Communications (JesCom), a religious organization, encouraged people to have a personal stake in the movie by asking for local and foreign donations. </p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FGomBurZaFilm%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02jAjJ7fhjD9gcXge2Mf2vEeYtAb8ytVyMA6khzj2Szr8uP7Pd6Bc7cGAMopwbTYLnl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""793"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p>Since it’s a historical and religious film, the <em>GomBurZa</em> team was also able to tap schools and the clergy to promote the movie. For instance, schools can sponsor special cinema <em>GomBurZa</em> screenings, dubbed “<em>Dalhin ang Eskwelahan sa Sinehan</em>” (Bring the School to the Cinema). </p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FGomBurZaFilm%2Fposts%2Fpfbid021TBQ5ZYsBU7mupag7DQKoqEwjRSUqHFxGQsHBSzo2pLLNJ3Cqoo7KzU9fbyvg4acl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""849"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p>They also had special block screenings by Catholics such as the Archdiocese of San Fernando and other religious groups in Pampanga. These have helped extend the movie in theaters. It was still showing in more than 30 cinemas five weeks after opening on December 25, when movies are normally replaced with new ones after two weeks. </p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FGomBurZaFilm%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0UcKRjrzUVCazhBf9TgTz6FADrLGFxhtPbS92D931n6fCycpd8G4f6KUmQAgwhjU1l&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""737"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p>Some of the screenings were also held for a cause, with proceeds supporting, for instance, the Pawssion Project, a non-profit organization that rescues cats and dogs.&nbsp;</p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FGomBurZaFilm%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02mfyjoyrt6udNc2eQPoL3hzwjtqtDmqWaDGtvAkwUuiKq2ubq8mypKLvBTNB23gNfl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""735"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p><em>GomBurZa</em> went into merchandising by producing t-shirts that were sold during events and online, although <em>GG</em> likewise has this. </p>



<div class=""fb-container""><iframe loading=""lazy"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D786305590181054%26set%3Da.192256489585970%26type%3D3&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=350"" width=""350"" height=""735"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share""></iframe></div>



<p><em>GomBurZa</em> is likely to get more acclaim in the <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/best-picture-winner-manila-international-film-festival-chance-make-united-states-feature-film/"">first Manila International Film Festival</a> (MIFF) in Los Angeles, California from January 29 to February 2. The winner in the MIFF will get a chance to make&nbsp;US-based feature film co-produced by Birns &amp; Sawyer. </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-s-next"">What&#8217;s next? </h5>



<p>After <em>GomBurZa</em> and <em>GG</em>, what&#8217;s next for MVP&#8217;s MQuest Ventures?  </p>



<p>&#8220;Apart from <em>GG</em>, there are several other movies that we have planned for the year,&#8221; Basas told Rappler. These films may not necessarily come out in movie theaters as its first window, given the breadth of our video platforms. The goal is to continue to make quality and meaningful Filipino films, distribute them so that many Filipinos can watch, and hopefully, also help get the Filipino audience back into cinemas.&#8221; </p>



<p>She said Pangilinan’s MediaQuest Holdings, where she is also president and CEO, owns “multiple platforms that allow for multiple monetization models.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Investing in films also comes naturally to us as we own and operate multiple video platforms across our group: from free-to-air, to direct-to-home and cable pay tv services, OTT [Over The Top] subscription services, and other digital platforms. This means that monetization for these film projects can happen across all our media assets, and therefore risks are mitigated,” Basas said. </p>



<p>She added they believe these investments will redound to the good of the country. </p>



<p>&#8220;When these film investments are made, it is always with the intention of maximizing monetization across these platforms. In the end, we are confident we can make a substantial contribution to creative industries in our country.&#8221;&nbsp;– <strong>Rappler.com </strong></p>

","<p>(1st UPDATE) A week after opening in cinemas, MQuest Ventures and Mediaworks&#8217; movie, GG, falters at the box-office. As of Thursday, February 1, only a few cinemas were showing the Philippines’ first full-length esports movie. </p>
",https://www.rappler.com/business/manny-pangilinan-movie-gambles-gomburza-philippines-e-sports-film-good-games/,2024-01-31T21:49:23,2024-02-01T07:12:52,"[621, 625, 629, 624, 631]","Manny Pangilinan's movie gambles: After ‘GomBurZa' win, it's PH's first esports film ‘Good Game'","  MANILA, Philippines - After a successful investment in the critically acclaimed historical film,  GomBurZa , tycoon Manny V. Pangilinan (MVP) is not afraid to take more gambles in the risky movie business after putting in money in the film,  GG  or  Good Game , starring Donnie Pangilinan and his mother, actress Maricel Laxa-Pangilinan.                GG , which opened in theaters on January 24, is jointly produced by MVP's MQuest Ventures, Mediaworks, and Create Cinema, a production house that focuses on ""groundbreaking cinema.""       It's a high-stakes gamble for the producers since the movie veers away from the usual romance or rom-com, horror, and fantasy that moviegoers are familiar with.  GG  is the Philippines' first full-length esports movie that depicts the challenges and victories of esports players. Donny plays Seth, an aspiring, passionate egamer.       Jane Basas, president and CEO of Pangilinan's MQuest Ventures, told Rappler they're ""definitely upbeat"" with the Philippine movie industry, especially after a successful Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) 2023 which set a  new box-office festival record  of P1.069 billion as of January 7.       In an email interview with Rappler, Basas said  GomBurZa  was ""well-received because it appealed to the sense of nationalism that we Filipinos share, and because it told the compelling and emotionally-charged story of the martyrdom of the three Filipino priests.""      ""Watching movies in cinemas will remain part of how Filipinos spend quality time with friends and family. Times have changed, but we are definitely upbeat because of how the Pinoy audience reacted to  GomBurZa  and the other films of the Metro Manila Film Festival. We hope to continue to do our part in growing the movie audience by producing films that people will love to watch,"" she added.       Basas declined to say how much  GomBurZa  earned in the box-office, but MMFF chairman Don Artes earlier said most MMFF films had 8-digit earnings.        GomBurZa  won the most number of awards in the MMFF's 49th edition, including 2nd Best Picture, Best Cinematography, Best Director (Pepe Diokno), Best Actor (Cedrick Juan as Father Burgos), Best Production Design, Best Sound Design, and the Gatpuno Antonio Villegas Cultural Award.               GG,  however, is unlikely to reach the success of the Pepe Diokno-helmed historical film, which was still showing in select Philippine cinemas four weeks after it premiered in the MMFF on December 25, 2023. Only a few cinemas were still showing  GG  as of February 1, Thursday.

Team Pangilinan      MQuest Ventures may have gotten the perfect partner in professional coach Anthony Pangilinan's outfit, Mediaworks, for this movie project.        Like what many of those behind the top MMFF entries did to make people watch their films, the whole Pangilinan family is actively promoting  GG  throughout the country.

It's his first movie production and he's using his skills as motivational speaker to get people to watch the movie. He's also been active on his social media accounts, updating the public on his family's promotional activities.               For instance, in his post on January 30, Tuesday, Anthony talked about the roots of the Pangilinan family in Pampanga as they visited the province in central Luzon, a roughly two-hour drive north from Manila.       ""Not sure people know but we come from Pampanga. On my side, my Daddy Dony from Sto. Tomas, and on  @mommymaricel 's side, Daddy Tony from Macabebe!"" he said.               Former Senator Kiko Pangilinan, with 1.1 million followers on Facebook, has given his full support to his younger brother, calling  GG  a ""great movie!!!"" and showing up at the movie premiere on January 23. Kiko got 9.3 million votes and placed second in the 2022 vice-presidential race that was won by Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte.        "" Ang ganda ng theme: family, passion, pagpupursige  (The theme is beautiful: family, passion, and perseverance),"" said Kiko at the premiere.               Gary Valenciano, another member of the clan, has urged his followers to watch the film, saying that it's not just about esports but about family. Gary's wife, Angeli, is the sister of the Pangilinan brothers.

Industry veterans said Star Cinema has not just the track record in producing  box-office hits  and r ecognizing good content , but it also has a good relationship with cinema operators.       GomBurZa campaign       GG  adopted a similar strategy taken by  GomBurZa  - the tried and tested on-the-ground campaign as well as tri-media promotions. There are, differences, however, which could lead to a different outcome.       For instance,  GomBurZa  co-producer Jesuit Communications (JesCom), a religious organization, encouraged people to have a personal stake in the movie by asking for local and foreign donations.               Since it's a historical and religious film, the  GomBurZa  team was also able to tap schools and the clergy to promote the movie. For instance, schools can sponsor special cinema  GomBurZa  screenings, dubbed "" Dalhin ang Eskwelahan sa Sinehan "" (Bring the School to the Cinema).               They also had special block screenings by Catholics such as the Archdiocese of San Fernando and other religious groups in Pampanga. These have helped extend the movie in theaters. It was still showing in more than 30 cinemas five weeks after opening on December 25, when movies are normally replaced with new ones after two weeks.               Some of the screenings were also held for a cause, with proceeds supporting, for instance, the Pawssion Project, a non-profit organization that rescues cats and dogs.                GomBurZa  went into merchandising by producing t-shirts that were sold during events and online, although  GG  likewise has this.                GomBurZa  is likely to get more acclaim in the  first Manila International Film Festival  (MIFF) in Los Angeles, California from January 29 to February 2. The winner in the MIFF will get a chance to make US-based feature film co-produced by Birns & Sawyer.       What's next?       After  GomBurZa  and  GG , what's next for MVP's MQuest Ventures?        ""Apart from  GG , there are several other movies that we have planned for the year,"" Basas told Rappler. These films may not necessarily come out in movie theaters as its first window, given the breadth of our video platforms. The goal is to continue to make quality and meaningful Filipino films, distribute them so that many Filipinos can watch, and hopefully, also help get the Filipino audience back into cinemas.""       She said Pangilinan's MediaQuest Holdings, where she is also president and CEO, owns ""multiple platforms that allow for multiple monetization models.""       ""Investing in films also comes naturally to us as we own and operate multiple video platforms across our group: from free-to-air, to direct-to-home and cable pay tv services, OTT [Over The Top] subscription services, and other digital platforms. This means that monetization for these film projects can happen across all our media assets, and therefore risks are mitigated,"" Basas said.       She added they believe these investments will redound to the good of the country.       ""When these film investments are made, it is always with the intention of maximizing monetization across these platforms. In the end, we are confident we can make a substantial contribution to creative industries in our country."" -  Rappler.com        ALSO ON RAPPLER         Is there a new Filipino cinema audience?

<p>Liza Mazo, Office of Civil Defense (OCD) Caraga chief, said in a phone interview that there should be no room for complacency.</p>



<p>“We should have learned the lesson last week when we were complacent because there was only rain due to the shear line, and there was no typhoon, but it turned out there was extreme flooding,&#8221; Mazo said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let us warn our communities that this shear line, trough of the LPA, or amihan are not typhoons, but they bring strong winds and heavy rain. So, the residents in the lower areas, especially in flood-prone areas along riversides and hillsides, should evacuate,” she added.</p>



<p>Mazo added that the land is already saturated due to the severe flooding last week, so evacuation is necessary.</p>



<p>She said they have received reports of flooding and landslides in Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur, and some local government units have already done preemptive evacuation since Tuesday, January 31.</p>

<p>The municipalities of San Francisco, Trento, Rosario, and Veruela have suspended both classes and work in government offices.</p>



<p>The Agusan River Basin Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said that the trough of the low pressure area has brought a significant amount of rainfall over the Agusan River basin since Tuesday.</p>



<p>“Flooding and rain-induced landslides are still expected in areas that received a significant amount of rainfall since yesterday, and rising water levels along Agusan River and tributary rivers are still expected during the forecast period,” the advisory said.</p>

<p>UNITED NATIONS – The United States said on Tuesday, January 30, that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees needs to make &#8220;fundamental changes&#8221; before Washington will resume funding that was halted over Israeli accusations that some agency staff took part in the October 7 attack by Hamas militants.</p>



<p>US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield welcomed a UN inquiry into the&nbsp;accusations against staff&nbsp;at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and a planned agency review. She also said the US was seeking more detail from Israel about the allegations.</p>



<p>She described &#8220;fundamental changes&#8221; as: &#8220;We need to look at the organization, how it operates in Gaza, how they manage their staff and to ensure that people who commit criminal acts, such as these 12 individuals, are held accountable immediately so that UNRWA can continue the essential work that it&#8217;s doing.&#8221;</p>



<p>The accusations became public on Friday when UNRWA announced it had fired some staff after Israel provided the agency with information. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday that&nbsp;of 12 people implicated&nbsp;nine were fired, one is dead, and the identity of the remaining two was being clarified.</p>



<p>The United States – UNRWA&#8217;s biggest donor – temporarily paused its funding, along with a cascade of other countries. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday that Washington provides $300-400 million a year.</p>



<p>Miller said that in the current fiscal year, which began in October, the US had so far provided about $121 million to UNRWA.</p>



<p>Guterres met with dozens of UNRWA donors in New York for more than two hours on Tuesday to discuss the UN action being taken in response to the Israeli allegations and hear concerns. Several ambassadors described the meeting as constructive.</p>



<p>Guterres appealed to countries who had suspended UNRWA funding to reconsider and to &#8220;other countries, including those in the region, also to step up to the plate,&#8221; Palestinian U.N. envoy Riyad Mansour told reporters after the meeting.</p>



<p>China&#8217;s UN Ambassador Zhang Jun said Guterres shared information with donors about the individual accusations made against UNRWA staff.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are at a very critical moment in coping with the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and the war is still going on&#8230; we should not allow these individual cases to dilute our attention in pursuing a ceasefire,&#8221; Zhang told reporters.</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-no-substitution"">&#8216;No substitution&#8217;</h5>



<p>An Israeli intelligence dossier, seen by Reuters on Monday, includes accusations that some UNRWA staff took part in abductions and killings during the October 7 raid that sparked the&nbsp;Gaza war&nbsp;and alleges some 190 UNRWA employees have doubled as Hamas or Islamic Jihad militants.</p>



<p>The Palestinians have accused Israel of falsifying information to tarnish UNRWA.</p>



<p>UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday that Israel has not yet shared the intelligence dossier with the UN.</p>



<p>UNRWA employs 13,000 people in Gaza, running the enclave&#8217;s schools, its primary healthcare clinics and other social services, and distributing humanitarian aid.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every year, UNRWA shares its list of staff with the host countries where it works,&#8221; said Dujarric. &#8220;For the work that it does in Gaza and the West Bank, UNRWA shares the list of staff with both the Palestinian Authority and with the Israeli government, as the occupying power for those areas.&#8221;</p>



<p>Earlier on Tuesday, the UN Security Council expressed concern about the &#8220;dire and rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation&#8221; and urged all parties to work with U.N. Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag.</p>



<p>The statement by the 15-member council came after Kaag briefed the body behind closed doors for the first time since she was appointed about a month ago. Kaag said there was &#8220;no substitution&#8221; for the humanitarian role of UNRWA.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is no way that any organization can replace or substitute the tremendous capacity, the fabric of UNRWA, the ability and their knowledge of the population in Gaza,&#8221; Kaag told reporters after the briefing. <strong>– Rappler.com</strong></p>

<p>There are a few perks to being the chair emeritus of an organization. Since the position is mainly honorary and is awarded due to the person’s worthy contributions, there’s minimal work involved because it’s really the president/CEO who calls the shots.&nbsp;</p>

Since the position is mainly honorary and is awarded due to the person's worthy contributions, there's minimal work involved because it's really the president/CEO who calls the shots.       The chair emeritus normally provides guidance, advice, and mentors the younger generation of leaders. He or she also gets invited to important ceremonial gatherings, especially when VIPs are expected to attend.              For Filipino billionaire James Go, 83, chair emeritus of the Gokongwei Group's Universal Robina Corporation, Robinsons Land Corporation, and JG Summit Olefins Corporation, there's one perk in being chair emeritus that he treasures: he gets to wear comfortable rubber shoes, regardless of whether it's a formal or informal event.       During the inauguration of JG Summit Olefins Corporation's expanded petrochemical manufacturing facility in Batangas City last January 19, Go was wearing sneakers in the event, the lone VIP to do so among the most prominent VIPs, as this photo (below) from JG Summit president/CEO Lance Gokongwei's Facebook shows.         SNEAKER GUY.

2594332,timeline-jericho-rosales-kim-jones-relationship,TIMELINE: Jericho Rosales and Kim Jones’ relationship,"
<p>MANILA, Philippines – The real score between Jericho Rosales and Kim Jones has been a point of speculation for months as the two were consistently embroiled in breakup rumors. And on Monday, January 29, entrepreneur Ricco Ocampo – the couple’s godfather – put a stop to the rumor mill by confirming that the two have broken up. </p>



<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/29/24/jericho-rosales-wife-kim-jones-have-separated"">ABS-CBN News</a>, Ricco shared that the couple have been separated since 2019. </p>



<p>“While the friendship between the two remains, they have decided it is time to lead separate lives,” he said. “It was a mutual decision, an amicable separation, dealt with grace and maturity by both parties.” </p>



<p>As of writing, Jericho and Kim have yet to personally speak up about the split. However, prior to the statement about their breakup, both parties have neither confirmed nor addressed their split despite being asked about their status several times. </p>



<p>As their decade-long romance comes to an end, we look back at their relationship through the years: </p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-2011"">2011</h5>



<p>Jericho and Kim first met in 2011 through a dinner hosted by a common friend. At the time, the actor said he wasn’t keen on being romantically involved with someone as he wanted to take a break from having high-profile relationships. To note, his previous girlfriends include Kristine Hermosa, Cindy Kurleto, and Heart Evangelista. </p>



<p>But when a common friend showed Jericho photos of the Filipina-British aspiring model, he found her beautiful and readily agreed to go to the dinner. However, their first meeting wasn’t that special.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I didn&#8217;t get his jokes at first, I didn’t understand him. And then he didn&#8217;t understand me because my accent was so thick,” Kim said in a 2013 interview with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0C6TbRT4Nk""><em>The Buzz.</em></a><em> </em>Prior to moving to the Philippines in 2010, she grew up in Australia.</p>



<p>While Jericho was smitten by Kim, she wasn’t interested in dating. In a 2014 blog by <a href=""https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/sunday-life/2014/02/16/1290733/jericho-rosales-kim-jones-love-marriage-surfing"">Bianca Gonzalez through the Philippine Star, </a>the two recalled that Kim rejected Jericho’s invite to attend a concert and was replying to his messages days late and with just one-liners. </p>

<p>It was only months later when Kim had a change of heart.</p>



<p>“When we first met, we clicked on a friendly level. I was new here and I didn’t want to get into a relationship. But I sort of started to miss his friendship, so I asked him if he wanted to hang out. Then he invited me to go surfing,” she recalled. It was during this surfing trip that they really started bonding.</p>



<p>The two dated for eight months before making their relationship official on October 2011. </p>



<p>In early 2012, the actor told the public about his relationship with Kim when he made a guest appearance on <em>KrisTV. </em></p>



<p><em>“</em>It’s a really healthy relationship,” he said. “We support each other. It’s really nice.”</p>



<h5 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-2013"">2013</h5>



<p>Although having only dated for around two years, Jericho proposed to Kim on August 4, 2013 — which is also the model’s birthday. The actor popped the question during Sunday service at the New Life Church in Alabang. </p>



<p>In an Instagram post, he showed a photo of Kim wearing an engagement ring to announce the news. </p>



<p>“I love you, Miss Jones. You are the love of my life. Thank you for saying YES (to forever) to me,” he wrote. </p>

<p>When Kim attended New York Fashion Week in September 2018, Jericho went all-out in supporting her, and even tagged along to the event to become her assistant. Calling it his “Better Husband Project,” the actor shared that he was in charge of keeping Kim’s schedules, getting Uber rides, and steaming her clothes. </p>



<p>“Seeing the results of all the hard work you’ve put into your career (and hair) makes me so proud. Keep doing what you do. I got your back,” he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We don’t want to be trapped by the ideas of marriage,” he said. “In our own experience, we didn’t have parameters. For us, we go against culture. Not because we hate it.

<p>Around two weeks later, Ricco Ocampo – Jericho and Kim’s godfather at their wedding – disclosed that the two have parted ways. </p>



<p>“The split is not borne out of ill feelings. On the contrary, one might say that is a demonstration of their affection and respect, as Echo and Kim only wish the best for each other,” Ocampo&#8217;s statement to ABS-CBN News read. </p>

And on Monday, January 29, entrepreneur Ricco Ocampo - the couple's godfather - put a stop to the rumor mill by confirming that the two have broken up.       In an interview with  ABS-CBN News , Ricco shared that the couple have been separated since 2019.       ""While the friendship between the two remains, they have decided it is time to lead separate lives,"" he said. ""It was a mutual decision, an amicable separation, dealt with grace and maturity by both parties.""       As of writing, Jericho and Kim have yet to personally speak up about the split. However, prior to the statement about their breakup, both parties have neither confirmed nor addressed their split despite being asked about their status several times.       As their decade-long romance comes to an end, we look back at their relationship through the years:       2011      Jericho and Kim first met in 2011 through a dinner hosted by a common friend. At the time, the actor said he wasn't keen on being romantically involved with someone as he wanted to take a break from having high-profile relationships. To note, his previous girlfriends include Kristine Hermosa, Cindy Kurleto, and Heart Evangelista.       But when a common friend showed Jericho photos of the Filipina-British aspiring model, he found her beautiful and readily agreed to go to the dinner. However, their first meeting wasn't that special.       ""I didn't get his jokes at first, I didn't understand him. And then he didn't understand me because my accent was so thick,"" Kim said in a 2013 interview with   The Buzz.     Prior to moving to the Philippines in 2010, she grew up in Australia.      While Jericho was smitten by Kim, she wasn't interested in dating. In a 2014 blog by  Bianca Gonzalez through the Philippine Star,  the two recalled that Kim rejected Jericho's invite to attend a concert and was replying to his messages days late and with just one-liners.              .igframe iframe{ background: white;  max-width: 540px;  width: calc(100% - 2px);  border-radius: 3px;  border: 1px solid rgb(219, 219, 219);  box-shadow: none;  display: block;  margin: 0px 0px 12px;  min-width: 326px;  padding: 0px; height: 967px; } @media screen and (max-width: 760px){ .igframe iframe{ height: 710px; }u }             It was only months later when Kim had a change of heart.      ""When we first met, we clicked on a friendly level. I was new here and I didn't want to get into a relationship. But I sort of started to miss his friendship, so I asked him if he wanted to hang out. Then he invited me to go surfing,"" she recalled. It was during this surfing trip that they really started bonding.      The two dated for eight months before making their relationship official on October 2011.       In early 2012, the actor told the public about his relationship with Kim when he made a guest appearance on  KrisTV.         "" It's a really healthy relationship,"" he said. ""We support each other. It's really nice.""      2013      Although having only dated for around two years, Jericho proposed to Kim on August 4, 2013 -- which is also the model's birthday. The actor popped the question during Sunday service at the New Life Church in Alabang.       In an Instagram post, he showed a photo of Kim wearing an engagement ring to announce the news.       ""I love you, Miss Jones. You are the love of my life. Thank you for saying YES (to forever) to me,"" he wrote.              .igframe iframe{ background: white;  max-width: 540px;  width: calc(100% - 2px);  border-radius: 3px;  border: 1px solid rgb(219, 219, 219);  box-shadow: none;  display: block;  margin: 0px 0px 12px;  min-width: 326px;  padding: 0px; height: 967px; } @media screen and (max-width: 760px){ .igframe iframe{ height: 710px; }u }             Kim also made a post on her own, saying that the actor made her ""the happiest lady in the world.""      2014      Jericho and Kim tied the knot on May 1, 2014 in an intimate beach wedding in Boracay.                    Play  Video                     2018      When Kim attended New York Fashion Week in September 2018, Jericho went all-out in supporting her, and even tagged along to the event to become her assistant. Calling it his ""Better Husband Project,"" the actor shared that he was in charge of keeping Kim's schedules, getting Uber rides, and steaming her clothes.

<p>From 2021 to 2023, the PUP’S College Admission Evaluation, done online, served as its alternative qualifying assessment as a result of the pandemic.</p>



<p>Charie Ledesma, 48, had three of her children already graduated from the state-owned university and still accompanied her youngest daughter to take its entrance test this year. The motivation for free tuition and quality teaching in the university makes her trust PUP the most for her children&#8217;s education.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Aside sa hindi mo na iisipin yung bayad, masasabi mo na talagang tamang desisyon na dito kami sa PUP nagpa-aral ng anak, kapareha lang ng mga may bayad. Nakita ko naman dun sa tatlong anak ko na okay yung naging outcome,”</em> Ledesma said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Aside from not minding the tuition, we can really say that it&#8217;s the right decision for our children to enroll in PUP. It&#8217;s just like other universities with tuition. I have seen good outcomes from my three children.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ledesma said that being a PUP graduate helped her three children to be swiftly employed right after graduating from the university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a 2023 survey by employment platform JobStreet, PUP tops the most preferred school of Filipino employers at 23.39% in hiring new employees due to its graduates being &#8220;effective team players in the workplace.&#8221;</p>



<p>PUP is also among the four Philippine universities that recently <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/philippines/quacquarelli-symonds-world-university-rankings-asia-2024/"">debuted</a> in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings in Asia for 2024, ranking 51-100 alongside the University of San Carlos in Cebu.</p>



<p>Jhon Von Jewelrick Alzate, a 17-year-old Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics student, took a 24-hour commute from Borongan, Eastern Samar to Santa Mesa, Manila just to take the annual admission test. Applying for the university&#8217;s psychology program, he is hoping to be one of the Iskolars ng Bayan (nation&#8217;s scholars) from PUP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alzate, the eldest among three siblings, relies on his father&#8217;s side hustle in a small hardware store in Samar, which gives them just enough money to provide for daily needs. Such a financial constraint limits Alzates&#8217; dreams for his education, including his capability to take an entrance exam to Manila.</p>



<p>Stumbling upon a group of his co-examinees on Facebook, however, helped him garner donations online for him to travel and take the exam.</p>



<p>Despite being challenged by financial requirements and the school being far from his home, Alzates said he is determined to pursue his education at PUP due to its tuition grants and the higher chance of having greater opportunities after graduation.</p>



<p>Alzates said he dreams of being a psychologist, and advocate for mental health among Filipinos. He said studying at PUP would help him become closer to his dreams and the opportunities that the university can give to financially challenged students outside Luzon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PUP is among the beneficiaries of the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017, which mandates free tuition and other fees for all state universities and colleges (SUCs) in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the law, its undergraduate students paid P12 per unit since 1979.</p>



<p>Aside from free tuition and international rankings, PUP President Manuel Muhi told Rappler that despite the university&#8217;s lack of budget, PUP receives around 100,000 national applicants annually due to its top performance in nationwide board exams.</p>



<p>In the 2023 Bar examinations, PUP ranked 1st among law schools with 51-100 candidates in the all-candidates category. It also produced topnotchers in the recent licensure examinations for civil engineers and certified public accountants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PUP administration has called on Congress to increase its budget so it can maintain its services to thousands of students relying on free tuition. According to the <a href=""https://www.dbm.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/NEP2024/SUCS/A/A5.pdf"">National Expenditure Program (NEP)</a> of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), PUP was given a P2.8-billion budget for 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Muhi also debunked the allegations of the return of tuition collections in the university after the Senate Committee on Higher, Technical, and Vocational Education approved Senate Bill No. 2248 last October. The <a href=""https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/242008-opinion-pup-national-university-bill/"">National Polytechnic University</a> (NPU) bill seeks to grant institutional and fiscal autonomy to PUP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PUP Vice President for Student Affairs and Services Tomas Testor said there are over 98,000 PUPCET applicants this year with around 20,000 taking the exams by batch. The majority of the applicants come from the National Capital Region (NCR). – <strong>Rappler.com</strong></p>

Despite being challenged by financial requirements and the school being far from his home, Alzates said he is determined to pursue his education at PUP due to its tuition grants and the higher chance of having greater opportunities after graduation.      Alzates said he dreams of being a psychologist, and advocate for mental health among Filipinos. He said studying at PUP would help him become closer to his dreams and the opportunities that the university can give to financially challenged students outside Luzon.       PUP is among the beneficiaries of the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act of 2017, which mandates free tuition and other fees for all state universities and colleges (SUCs) in the country.       Before the law, its undergraduate students paid P12 per unit since 1979.      Aside from free tuition and international rankings, PUP President Manuel Muhi told Rappler that despite the university's lack of budget, PUP receives around 100,000 national applicants annually due to its top performance in nationwide board exams.      In the 2023 Bar examinations, PUP ranked 1st among law schools with 51-100 candidates in the all-candidates category. It also produced topnotchers in the recent licensure examinations for civil engineers and certified public accountants.       The PUP administration has called on Congress to increase its budget so it can maintain its services to thousands of students relying on free tuition. According to the  National Expenditure Program (NEP)  of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), PUP was given a P2.8-billion budget for 2024.       Muhi also debunked the allegations of the return of tuition collections in the university after the Senate Committee on Higher, Technical, and Vocational Education approved Senate Bill No. 2248 last October. The  National Polytechnic University  (NPU) bill seeks to grant institutional and fiscal autonomy to PUP.       PUP Vice President for Student Affairs and Services Tomas Testor said there are over 98,000 PUPCET applicants this year with around 20,000 taking the exams by batch. The majority of the applicants come from the National Capital Region (NCR). -  Rappler.com        Chris Burnet Ramos is an Aries Rufo fellow.

<p>Husband and wife tandem Celine and Dennis Murillo are on a mission to show fellow Filipinos the beauty and wealth of the Philippines’ rich biodiversity as they travel around the country in their camper van, which they fondly call Eli.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through their information videos and photography on their YouTube channel and individual social media platforms, they are bringing awareness to the country’s native trees, endangered wildlife, protected landscapes, and more.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s disheartening that the majority of Filipinos would recognize a cherry blossom but not a salinggogon or a balai-lamok. That they would know what a giraffe or a panda is, but not a tamaraw or a binturon,” Celine said. “Hopefully, they get to share in the wonder of our discoveries as we travel around the Philippines, prompt them to re-connect with the natural world, and advocate for ways of living that are more compassionate and in harmony with the rest of the planet.”</p>

<p>The two had long been into adventure and storytelling. Celine kept a personal travel blog and contributed travel articles to different publications as a freelancer, while Dennis took travel photos as a serious hobbyist in his free time from his full-time job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as the pair traveled more, they felt the call to dive deeper into the Philippines’ rich wildlife, mountains, and other diverse landscapes. During the COVID lockdown, the two converted a pre-loved van into a camper one. As pandemic restrictions eased, they packed their belongings and drove off to Sorsogon, the hometown of Celine’s mother, before crossing via RORO to Visayas then to Mindanao.</p>

<p>“We wanted to document wildlife, wild places, and the intertwining of nature and culture, and to do this meaningfully, this requires staying in a place for long periods. A camper van allows us to do that,” the couple said. They added that “getting to know a place&#8217;s bio- and cultural biodiversity is more fulfilling for us.”</p>



<p>Immersing in particular places helped them have memorable experiences, like seeing and photographing the Philippine eagle: “It took us two months of tracking the fledgling before we were finally able to see it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These moments are bittersweet, as the couple is painfully aware that “each encounter is always complicated because along with the wonder and awe, is the grief and sorrow that comes from knowing all of it could be lost if we remain unaware of the treasures of our forests.”</p>

<p>This understanding fuels them to keep on with their advocacy on biodiversity and conservation awareness. To fund this work, they also enter contests and apply for related grants, an example being the Young ASEAN Storyteller grant. Celine, with Dennis’ help, did <a href=""https://artsandculture.google.com/story/3AWxmNzV5EcLaQ?fbclid=IwAR1ju5U--di2NP4XUDNep654eHZ4u3Z-XCKXQVjfko17_GYOenLDIH8KGcU"">creative narrative videos and other content</a> on Bukidnon’s Mt. Kitanglad, an ASEAN Heritage Park where endangered species like the Philippine eagle live and where indigenous communities live in harmony with nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the kindness of strangers encourages the couple to keep traveling via camper van. </p>



<p>“When our van broke down, we realized that there are many people ready to help us even though they don’t know us,” Dennis said.</p>

<p>If you chance upon a unique and interesting Philippine ingredient or food in your Facebook feed, there is a chance that Philippine food heritage advocate John Sherwin Felix is the one behind it, or at least the one who first posted about it on social media. Sherwin’s <a href=""https://web.facebook.com/johnsherwin.felix/posts/pfbid02tW5gdeSrG6YgPX6KcbAy2sXH3WxVoUqyqsa1mvNk1TUT5vBCN6bdxv8puKwqo5TFl?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr"">Facebook post on asin tibuok</a> was in fact the first viral post on this labor-intensive, artisanal salt.

The asin tibuok is painstakingly made by soaking coconut husks in saltwater for months then dried until the salt is absorbed. After that, the coconut husks will be burned and the ashes will be gathered then placed in saltwater again. The water filtered from this mixture will be poured in clay pots then boiled.

<p>Sherwin travels around the Philippines to document native and introduced fruits, vegetables, herbs, edible plants, and food prepared from these ingredients. He is especially keen on researching ingredients that are not well-known. He visits public markets, talks to locals, verifies his information, takes photos, and creates social media posts that pique the interest even of those unfamiliar with his advocacy.</p>

<p>Sherwin said his love for food began when he was a child, as he grew up in a home where everyone cooked. </p>



<p>“That love for food transformed into a passion for documenting and researching heritage food and ingredients, particularly during the pandemic,” he said. He noticed that online, most discussions focused only on “basic Philippine ingredients like vinegar, kalamansi, patis, etc.”</p>



<p>Sherwin began to explore more ingredients starting from the public market in Mindoro, his family’s home. As COVID restrictions eased, he started documenting many “unheard of” ingredients and sharing them in his personal account. Eventually, he started Lokalpedia, a visual archive of local, heirloom, underutilized, endangered, and artisanal Philippine ingredients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I told myself that I don’t want to create the typical content that usually sensationalizes and exoticizes our food,” Sherwin said. “I want to create an online resource that is accessible, honest, and reflects the on-ground experience of the locals.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sherwin has been praised online for his dedication and thoroughness in his content. He has also been invited to talk about food heritage in schools and in food-related events.</p>



<p>In 2022, Sherwin quit his public relations job to focus on his advocacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Diving into communities, chatting with locals, and trying new food just made me happy and fulfilled. So, I ditched my 9-to-5 and became a full-time wanderer,” he said. “But now I can say there can be a career in this because recently, I got some paid talks/presentations and a small cultural and biodiversity mapping project with an NGO. The paychecks aren&#8217;t as fat, but the joy I get is off the charts.”</p>

<p>While most of his travel funds come from his personal savings and earnings from selling his pop culture collectibles, he said that supporters of his advocacy were a big help as many gave him a place to stay – even as he insisted on paying – or showed him around in his travels.</p>



<p>2023 was his most prolific year in travel and documentation, having visited 20 provinces. He plans to continue his advocacy in raising awareness on Philippine ingredients. He is happy that many of the ingredients he featured in his page have reached mainstream consciousness, with some even included in a Netflix series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As he continues in his advocacy, he said that his next goal is to publish a book that “encapsulates our food heritage and biodiversity.” He will be narrowing the thousands of edibles into 100 Philippine ingredients and food items from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. </p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not going to cover every resource our country&#8217;s got, but it will be a colorful tapestry of Philippine cuisine,” he said in excitement.</p>

Marco on his way to Kalayaan, Palawan, the last destination of his 1634 PH adventure. Contributed photo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Visiting the Philippines’ 82 provinces is many a Filipino adventurer’s dream. However, Arvid Marius “Marco” Puzon went beyond this usual goal by visiting all 1,634 cities and municipalities of the country, a personal quest he named<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MarcodePH""> 1634 PH</a>. He is the first person to accomplish this feat.</p>



<p>Initially, Marco had just planned to visit all the Philippines’ provinces, but when he was on his 73rd (Surigao del Sur) and was facilitating a workshop in Barobo, he thought it did not feel right to tick off this province from his list when he just went to “a single town far from the capital.”</p>



<p>In 2013, when Marco’s job at a mining company was rendered redundant, he used the sudden free time to officially begin his 1634 PH journey. He went on several days of travel, or what he called “sorties,” to cover many municipalities in one trip. He started with places in Luzon, and documented each city and municipality in a detailed Excel sheet.</p>

Marco in Itbayat (his 268th), the northernmost municipality in the country, in 2013. Contributed photo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Marco’s criteria to tick off a city or municipality is to visit, at the very least, “the <em>plaza mayor</em> (city/town square) and the structures, monuments, historical markers, and novel points of interests around it.”</p>



<p>The friends and connections Marco gained over the years, especially in his experience as a tour guide and his consultancies in NGOs, helped him reach places tourists would usually find hard to visit.</p>



<p>Marco had set a target to complete all 1,634 cities and municipalities within 10 years, and with just seven remaining municipalities to visit in 2020, he was going to finish ahead of schedule. However, the COVID pandemic lockdown abruptly halted his travels. And, with the sudden airport closures, he was stranded for three months.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-full""><img decoding=""async"" loading=""lazy"" width=""960"" height=""960"" src=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/01/3-Destination-before-COVID-pandemic.png"" alt=""Beach, Coast, Nature"" class=""wp-image-2592950"" srcset=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/01/3-Destination-before-COVID-pandemic.png?resize=960%2C960&amp;zoom=1 960w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/01/3-Destination-before-COVID-pandemic.png?resize=960%2C960&amp;zoom=0.5 480w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/01/3-Destination-before-COVID-pandemic.png?resize=960%2C960&amp;zoom=0.25 240w"" sizes=""(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">BEFORE COVID.

<p>When the COVID restrictions were lifted, Marco still found the logistics of going to Kalayaan, Palawan challenging. The municipality is part of Spratly Islands, a source of territorial tension between Philippines and China. Marco had written to the local government and to different government agencies before the pandemic, but was not able to secure a trip even in 2022.</p>



<p>Marco resigned himself to only completing 1,633 – one municipality shy of his target, until Kalayaan’s local government informed him of the first expedition open to tourists in March 2023. Joining this organized trip allowed him to finish his 1634 PH quest on schedule.</p>



<p>He felt “very elated, almost being moved to tears” when he set foot on Pag-asa Island.</p>

<p>“1634 PH is an ‘insane’ life goal that I have thankfully achieved with the assistance of hundreds of people nationwide. I have learned so much, evolving from who I was from No. 1 (San Ildefonso in Bulacan) to who I am now after No. 1,634 (Kalayaan in Palawan), and each number in between is a treasure,” Marco said.</p>



<p>With his completion of 1634 PH, Marco remains humble and in wonder of the Philippines.</p>



<p>“There are still so many places to see [in our country],” he said, adding he is not keen to go on an overseas quest just yet. Inspired by a New Zealand-based cartographer and as an offshoot to his 1634 PH quest, he has just visited his 85th of the Philippines’ 100 biggest islands. Also, one of his planned future trips is returning to some memorable places for him in Mindanao.</p>

<p><strong>Explore your city/town first. </strong>There are gems waiting to be discovered, right where you are. Marco encourages fellow Filipinos to explore where they live first. He recounts that his guide in Sto. Niño, Samar, for example, was happy to see&nbsp;places even he as a local wasn’t able to go to before he accompanied Marco.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-if-you-want-to-have-a-smooth-trip-with-few-hassles-if-any"">If you want to have a smooth trip with few hassles, if any:</h3>



<p><strong>Research then plan your trip based on it. </strong>Marco advises to be prepared. “Ensure you have more than enough resources for a trip,” he said. He also said to consider safety in planning, which relates to his next advice below.</p>



<p><strong>Coordinate with the local government, especially in off-the-beaten-path areas. </strong>“I have learned to trust local information more than what I see online,” Marco revealed. To places not readily accessible to tourists, Marco says it is essential to contact local authorities in advance.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Safety first. </strong>Take safety precautions for your trip. Marco added not to forget to tell your mother – or loved ones – where you are and that you’re safe.</p>



<p><strong>Be aware of your priorities, especially in your budget. </strong>To ensure his travel fund goes a long way, Sherwin only stays in budget accommodations like guest houses. For him, “The real adventure is out there, not in your room.” He advises: “Don’t linger too long in your resort or hotel.”</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-if-you-want-to-have-a-meaningful-trip"">If you want to have a meaningful trip:</h3>



<p><strong>Go where the locals go. </strong>Eat local food, go to the local market, travel to places recommended by locals – seek local experiences.</p>



<p>Sherwin especially recommends going to the public market. </p>



<p>“[It] is the hub of local produce and artisanal goods. But the most wonderful thing about a public market is its ability to bring people from different ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds together. All in all, a public market is the heart and soul of a community. So don’t skip palengkes,” he advised.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-full""><img decoding=""async"" loading=""lazy"" width=""2560"" height=""1437"" src=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/01/8-Sibalom-public-market-scaled.jpg"" alt=""Bazaar, Market, Shop"" class=""wp-image-2592925"" srcset=""https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/01/8-Sibalom-public-market-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C1437&amp;zoom=1 2560w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/01/8-Sibalom-public-market-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C1437&amp;zoom=0.5 1280w, https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/01/8-Sibalom-public-market-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C1437&amp;zoom=0.25 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">MARKET. The market in Sibalom, Antique is among Sherwin’s favorites. Contributed photo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In relation to this, Marco advised “not to get caught up by monickers like Boracay of the North, Switzerland or New Zealand of the Philippines. Accept places as they are.”</p>



<p><strong>Make connections. </strong>Talk and spend time with the locals to make for an unforgettable trip. After finishing his 1634 PH quest, Marco shared what remains most important for him: “It is not the place but the people I have met and the links that I have formed.” He recounted strangers opening their homes to him, boatmen and motorbike drivers sharing their stories of struggle, and Philippine troops missing their loved ones back home, among others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, Sherwin said:&nbsp; “The moments that stand out for me are always the ones spent with the locals.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a whole different level of experience compared with just watching it on a travel vlog or reading online. Documenting enabled me to forge unique connections. It&#8217;s a diverse mix – farmers, fisherfolk, cooks, artisans, salt makers, you name it.”</p>



<p><strong>Choose liberating experiences. </strong>”When I was younger, I would tell people to just take the leap and go, as if it were that easy, “ Celine mused. “As years go by and our work became deeper, I now understand that it takes certain kinds of privileges to travel and pursue passions. Having said that, I&#8217;ve always believed that traveling should be liberating.</p>



<p>“So go look for and create experiences that would liberate you, that would take you outside of yourself and into the healing power of nature, community, and cooperation,” she encouraged. “And then, continue to embody this sense of liberation in ways like being mindful of your trash, being respectful towards the locals, and making sure that you support destinations that benefit the community and not exploit them.”</p>

<p><strong>Be flexible and open to possibilities. </strong>Sherwin said to be prepared “not just for the social media-worthy moments, but the messy, unplanned hiccups, too.” As an example, he said he had his heart set on certain foods or ingredients, only to find out they were not available that time. Being open, however, prompted him to a “detour that led me to something equally amazing.”&nbsp;</p>

Sherwin had planned to document the bunog, but it was out of season. A local led him to taste popwan instead, a relative of jackfruit. He mused: “If you tunnel-vision on one thing, you&#8217;ll miss out on a whole lot of interesting stuff.” Contributed photo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pay it forward. </strong>“If you ever get to achieve your goals, there is no greater pleasure in expressing gratitude and returning favors to those who helped you along your way, and helping others reach their own life goals and not just travel goals,” Marco said.</p>



<p>So when you set off on your own adventure, be willing to help others who are dreaming of their own, too.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-if-you-want-to-make-travel-your-lifestyle"">If you want to make travel your lifestyle:</h3>



<p><strong>Find opportunities to fund your lifestyle. </strong>While grants help fund their biodiversity advocacy, Celine and Dennis’ remote work pay for their expenses. Celine says it is important to be on the lookout for opportunities. She also accepts speaking engagements and does part-time training facilitation for climate awareness.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Dedicate a block of time for mastering your craft. </strong>If this is work that will especially support your travels or is related to travel, Dennis says to “spend at least two hours a day on it to bring you closer to your dream.” Dennis himself had been taking landscape photos for several years before he went all-in in their camper van adventure.</p>

Or, do you simply want to go to beautiful destinations that are calling you this 2024? Be inspired by these travelers who dared to set off on their own big unique adventures.      Celine and Dennis Murillo, traveling via camper van and telling Philippine wildlife and landscape stories         MEET ELI. The traveling couple with Eli, their camper van. All photos courtesy of the travelers        Husband and wife tandem Celine and Dennis Murillo are on a mission to show fellow Filipinos the beauty and wealth of the Philippines' rich biodiversity as they travel around the country in their camper van, which they fondly call Eli.       Through their information videos and photography on their YouTube channel and individual social media platforms, they are bringing awareness to the country's native trees, endangered wildlife, protected landscapes, and more.      ""It's disheartening that the majority of Filipinos would recognize a cherry blossom but not a salinggogon or a balai-lamok. That they would know what a giraffe or a panda is, but not a tamaraw or a binturon,"" Celine said. ""Hopefully, they get to share in the wonder of our discoveries as we travel around the Philippines, prompt them to re-connect with the natural world, and advocate for ways of living that are more compassionate and in harmony with the rest of the planet.""

Celine kept a personal travel blog and contributed travel articles to different publications as a freelancer, while Dennis took travel photos as a serious hobbyist in his free time from his full-time job.       However, as the pair traveled more, they felt the call to dive deeper into the Philippines' rich wildlife, mountains, and other diverse landscapes. During the COVID lockdown, the two converted a pre-loved van into a camper one. As pandemic restrictions eased, they packed their belongings and drove off to Sorsogon, the hometown of Celine's mother, before crossing via RORO to Visayas then to Mindanao.        MAYON.

A camper van allows us to do that,"" the couple said. They added that ""getting to know a place's bio- and cultural biodiversity is more fulfilling for us.""      Immersing in particular places helped them have memorable experiences, like seeing and photographing the Philippine eagle: ""It took us two months of tracking the fledgling before we were finally able to see it.""        These moments are bittersweet, as the couple is painfully aware that ""each encounter is always complicated because along with the wonder and awe, is the grief and sorrow that comes from knowing all of it could be lost if we remain unaware of the treasures of our forests.""                   Play  Video                     This understanding fuels them to keep on with their advocacy on biodiversity and conservation awareness. To fund this work, they also enter contests and apply for related grants, an example being the Young ASEAN Storyteller grant. Celine, with Dennis' help, did  creative narrative videos and other content  on Bukidnon's Mt. Kitanglad, an ASEAN Heritage Park where endangered species like the Philippine eagle live and where indigenous communities live in harmony with nature.        In addition, the kindness of strangers encourages the couple to keep traveling via camper van.       ""When our van broke down, we realized that there are many people ready to help us even though they don't know us,"" Dennis said.

Sherwin is passionate and thorough in his documentation of the country's local and introduced ingredients. Featured in this photo is pakaskas, a palm sugar delicacy in Isla Verde, Batangas. Contributed photo       If you chance upon a unique and interesting Philippine ingredient or food in your Facebook feed, there is a chance that Philippine food heritage advocate John Sherwin Felix is the one behind it, or at least the one who first posted about it on social media. Sherwin's  Facebook post on asin tibuok  was in fact the first viral post on this labor-intensive, artisanal salt. His write-up helped generate new interest in the salt's dying tradition in Albuquerque, Bohol.         ASIN TIBUOK. The asin tibuok is painstakingly made by soaking coconut husks in saltwater for months then dried until the salt is absorbed. After that, the coconut husks will be burned and the ashes will be gathered then placed in saltwater again. The water filtered from this mixture will be poured in clay pots then boiled. Contributed photo       Sherwin travels around the Philippines to document native and introduced fruits, vegetables, herbs, edible plants, and food prepared from these ingredients. He is especially keen on researching ingredients that are not well-known. He visits public markets, talks to locals, verifies his information, takes photos, and creates social media posts that pique the interest even of those unfamiliar with his advocacy.        DUGYAN. Dugyan, a red durian Sherwin saw in Palawan. In this province, Sherwin documented many unusual edibles as the province is also known for its rich wildlife - some of which can only be found here. Contributed photo       Sherwin said his love for food began when he was a child, as he grew up in a home where everyone cooked.       ""That love for food transformed into a passion for documenting and researching heritage food and ingredients, particularly during the pandemic,"" he said. He noticed that online, most discussions focused only on ""basic Philippine ingredients like vinegar, kalamansi, patis, etc.""      Sherwin began to explore more ingredients starting from the public market in Mindoro, his family's home. As COVID restrictions eased, he started documenting many ""unheard of"" ingredients and sharing them in his personal account. Eventually, he started Lokalpedia, a visual archive of local, heirloom, underutilized, endangered, and artisanal Philippine ingredients.         ITLOG NG ABUOS.  Itlog ng abuos (eggs of weaver ants), an Ilocano delicacy. Sherwin said he never refuses food offered to him by locals. ""You need to respect their culture and understand the landscape of their food,"" he said, adding that the ant eggs taste good. Contributed photo       ""I told myself that I don't want to create the typical content that usually sensationalizes and exoticizes our food,"" Sherwin said. ""I want to create an online resource that is accessible, honest, and reflects the on-ground experience of the locals.""         Sherwin has been praised online for his dedication and thoroughness in his content. He has also been invited to talk about food heritage in schools and in food-related events.      In 2022, Sherwin quit his public relations job to focus on his advocacy.       ""Diving into communities, chatting with locals, and trying new food just made me happy and fulfilled. So, I ditched my 9-to-5 and became a full-time wanderer,"" he said. ""But now I can say there can be a career in this because recently, I got some paid talks/presentations and a small cultural and biodiversity mapping project with an NGO. The paychecks aren't as fat, but the joy I get is off the charts.""        WITH THE YOUTH OF ABORLAN. Learning from locals is fulfilling for Sherwin, as well as sharing his knowledge. Here he is with the youth in Aborlan, Palawan after giving a lecture. Contributed photo       While most of his travel funds come from his personal savings and earnings from selling his pop culture collectibles, he said that supporters of his advocacy were a big help as many gave him a place to stay - even as he insisted on paying - or showed him around in his travels.      2023 was his most prolific year in travel and documentation, having visited 20 provinces. He plans to continue his advocacy in raising awareness on Philippine ingredients. He is happy that many of the ingredients he featured in his page have reached mainstream consciousness, with some even included in a Netflix series.         FAMILY TRADITION. Guimaras was one of Sherwin's 2023 destinations. Here he met three generations of the family making tultul, another artisanal salt. Contributed photo       As he continues in his advocacy, he said that his next goal is to publish a book that ""encapsulates our food heritage and biodiversity."" He will be narrowing the thousands of edibles into 100 Philippine ingredients and food items from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.       ""It's not going to cover every resource our country's got, but it will be a colorful tapestry of Philippine cuisine,"" he said in excitement.

Marco on his way to Kalayaan, Palawan, the last destination of his 1634 PH adventure. Contributed photo       Visiting the Philippines' 82 provinces is many a Filipino adventurer's dream. However, Arvid Marius ""Marco"" Puzon went beyond this usual goal by visiting all 1,634 cities and municipalities of the country, a personal quest he named  1634 PH . He is the first person to accomplish this feat.      Initially, Marco had just planned to visit all the Philippines' provinces, but when he was on his 73rd (Surigao del Sur) and was facilitating a workshop in Barobo, he thought it did not feel right to tick off this province from his list when he just went to ""a single town far from the capital.""      In 2013, when Marco's job at a mining company was rendered redundant, he used the sudden free time to officially begin his 1634 PH journey. He went on several days of travel, or what he called ""sorties,"" to cover many municipalities in one trip. He started with places in Luzon, and documented each city and municipality in a detailed Excel sheet.        BATANES. Marco in Itbayat (his 268th), the northernmost municipality in the country, in 2013. Contributed photo       Marco's criteria to tick off a city or municipality is to visit, at the very least, ""the  plaza mayor  (city/town square) and the structures, monuments, historical markers, and novel points of interests around it.""      The friends and connections Marco gained over the years, especially in his experience as a tour guide and his consultancies in NGOs, helped him reach places tourists would usually find hard to visit.      Marco had set a target to complete all 1,634 cities and municipalities within 10 years, and with just seven remaining municipalities to visit in 2020, he was going to finish ahead of schedule. However, the COVID pandemic lockdown abruptly halted his travels. And, with the sudden airport closures, he was stranded for three months.          BEFORE COVID. San Antonio, Samar was Marco's destination before the sudden COVID lockdown. Contributed photo       When the COVID restrictions were lifted, Marco still found the logistics of going to Kalayaan, Palawan challenging. The municipality is part of Spratly Islands, a source of territorial tension between Philippines and China. Marco had written to the local government and to different government agencies before the pandemic, but was not able to secure a trip even in 2022.      Marco resigned himself to only completing 1,633 - one municipality shy of his target, until Kalayaan's local government informed him of the first expedition open to tourists in March 2023. Joining this organized trip allowed him to finish his 1634 PH quest on schedule.      He felt ""very elated, almost being moved to tears"" when he set foot on Pag-asa Island.        PAG-ASA. Once Marco arrived at Kalayaan's municipal hall and related structures, he had officially visited his last municipality of his 1634 PH quest. Contributed photo         FLAG CEREMONY.  One of Marco's best 1634 PH memories is joining the Monday flag ceremony in Pag-Asa Island. ""Never have I ever been prouder to sing our anthem,"" he said. Contributed photo       ""1634 PH is an 'insane' life goal that I have thankfully achieved with the assistance of hundreds of people nationwide. I have learned so much, evolving from who I was from No. 1 (San Ildefonso in Bulacan) to who I am now after No. 1,634 (Kalayaan in Palawan), and each number in between is a treasure,"" Marco said.      With his completion of 1634 PH, Marco remains humble and in wonder of the Philippines.      ""There are still so many places to see [in our country],"" he said, adding he is not keen to go on an overseas quest just yet. Inspired by a New Zealand-based cartographer and as an offshoot to his 1634 PH quest, he has just visited his 85th of the Philippines' 100 biggest islands. Also, one of his planned future trips is returning to some memorable places for him in Mindanao.        SULU. Marco in Banguingui, Sulu (his 1,603rd) last 2019. Sulu is part of the itinerary for his Mindanao return trip. Contributed photo       Read more about Marco's 1634 PH adventure in  this article  and check out his  Facebook page .

Contributed photo       If you want to have a smooth trip with few hassles, if any:       Research then plan your trip based on it.  Marco advises to be prepared. ""Ensure you have more than enough resources for a trip,"" he said. He also said to consider safety in planning, which relates to his next advice below.       Coordinate with the local government, especially in off-the-beaten-path areas.  ""I have learned to trust local information more than what I see online,"" Marco revealed. To places not readily accessible to tourists, Marco says it is essential to contact local authorities in advance.        Safety first.  Take safety precautions for your trip. Marco added not to forget to tell your mother - or loved ones - where you are and that you're safe.       Be aware of your priorities, especially in your budget.  To ensure his travel fund goes a long way, Sherwin only stays in budget accommodations like guest houses. For him, ""The real adventure is out there, not in your room."" He advises: ""Don't linger too long in your resort or hotel.""      If you want to have a meaningful trip:       Go where the locals go.  Eat local food, go to the local market, travel to places recommended by locals - seek local experiences.      Sherwin especially recommends going to the public market.       ""[It] is the hub of local produce and artisanal goods. But the most wonderful thing about a public market is its ability to bring people from different ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds together. All in all, a public market is the heart and soul of a community. So don't skip palengkes,"" he advised.        MARKET. The market in Sibalom, Antique is among Sherwin's favorites. Contributed photo       In relation to this, Marco advised ""not to get caught up by monickers like Boracay of the North, Switzerland or New Zealand of the Philippines. Accept places as they are.""       Make connections.  Talk and spend time with the locals to make for an unforgettable trip. After finishing his 1634 PH quest, Marco shared what remains most important for him: ""It is not the place but the people I have met and the links that I have formed."" He recounted strangers opening their homes to him, boatmen and motorbike drivers sharing their stories of struggle, and Philippine troops missing their loved ones back home, among others.       Similarly, Sherwin said:  ""The moments that stand out for me are always the ones spent with the locals.  It's a whole different level of experience compared with just watching it on a travel vlog or reading online. Documenting enabled me to forge unique connections. It's a diverse mix - farmers, fisherfolk, cooks, artisans, salt makers, you name it.""       Choose liberating experiences.  ""When I was younger, I would tell people to just take the leap and go, as if it were that easy, "" Celine mused. ""As years go by and our work became deeper, I now understand that it takes certain kinds of privileges to travel and pursue passions. Having said that, I've always believed that traveling should be liberating.      ""So go look for and create experiences that would liberate you, that would take you outside of yourself and into the healing power of nature, community, and cooperation,"" she encouraged. ""And then, continue to embody this sense of liberation in ways like being mindful of your trash, being respectful towards the locals, and making sure that you support destinations that benefit the community and not exploit them.""

Sherwin said to be prepared ""not just for the social media-worthy moments, but the messy, unplanned hiccups, too."" As an example, he said he had his heart set on certain foods or ingredients, only to find out they were not available that time. Being open, however, prompted him to a ""detour that led me to something equally amazing.""         WELCOME DETOUR. Sherwin had planned to document the bunog, but it was out of season. A local led him to taste popwan instead, a relative of jackfruit. He mused: ""If you tunnel-vision on one thing, you'll miss out on a whole lot of interesting stuff.""

""If you ever get to achieve your goals, there is no greater pleasure in expressing gratitude and returning favors to those who helped you along your way, and helping others reach their own life goals and not just travel goals,"" Marco said.      So when you set off on your own adventure, be willing to help others who are dreaming of their own, too.
